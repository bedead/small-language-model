       "'CHESS FUNDAMENTALS\\n\\nPART I\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nFIRST PRINCIPLES: ENDINGS, MIDDLE-GAME AND OPENINGS\\n\\nThe first thing a student should do, is to familiarise himself with the\\npower of the pieces. This can best be done by learning how to accomplish\\nquickly some of the simple mates.\\n\\n1. SOME SIMPLE MATES\\n\\nEXAMPLE 1.--The ending Rook and King against King.\\n\\n_The principle is to drive the opposing King to the last line on any side\\nof the board_.\\n\\n[Illustration] {4}\\n\\nIn this position the power of the Rook is demonstrated by the first move,\\nR - R 7, which immediately confines the Black King to the last rank, and\\nthe mate is quickly accomplished by: 1 R - R 7, K - Kt 1; 2 K - Kt 2.\\n\\nThe combined action of King and Rook is needed to arrive at a position in\\nwhich mate can be forced. The general principle for a beginner to follow is\\nto\\n\\n_keep his King as much as possible on the same rank, or, as in this case,\\nfile, as the opposing King._\\n\\nWhen, in this case, the King has been brought to the sixth rank, it is\\nbetter to place it, not on the same file, but on the one next to it towards\\nthe centre.\\n\\n2...K - B 1; 3 K - B 3, K - K 1; 4 K - K 4, K - Q 1; 5 K - Q 5, K - B 1;\\n6 K - Q 6.\\n\\nNot K - B 6, because then the Black King will go back to Q 1 and it will\\ntake much longer to mate. If now the King moves back to Q 1, R - R 8 mates\\nat once.\\n\\n6...K - Kt 1; 7 R - Q B 7, K - R 1; 8 K - B 6, K - Kt 1; 9 K - Kt 6,\\nK - R 1; 10 R - B 8 mate.\\n\\nIt has taken exactly ten moves to mate from the original position. On move\\n5 Black could have played K - K 1, and, according to principle, White would\\nhave continued 6 K - Q 6, K - B 1 (the Black King will ultimately be forced\\nto move in front of the White King and be mated by R - R 8); 7 K - K 6,\\nK - Kt 1; 8 K - B 6, K - R 1; 9 K - Kt 6, K - Kt 1; 10 R - R 8 mate. {5}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 2.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSince the Black King is in the centre of the board, the best way to proceed\\nis to advance your own King thus: 1 K - K 2, K - Q 4; 2 K - K 3. As the\\nRook has not yet come into play, it is better to advance the King straight\\ninto the centre of the board, not in front, but to one side of the other\\nKing. Should now the Black King move to K 4, the Rook drives it back by\\nR - R 5 ch. On the other hand, if 2... K - B 5 instead, then also\\n3 R - R 5. If now 3... K - Kt 5, there follows 4 K - Q 3; but if instead\\n3... K - B 6; then 4 R - R 4, keeping the King confined to as few squares\\nas possible.\\n\\nNow the ending may continue: 4...K - B 7; 5 R - B 4 ch, K - Kt 6;\\n6 K - Q 3, K - Kt 7; 7 R - Kt 4 ch, K - R 6; 8 K - B 3, K - R 7. It should\\nbe noticed how often the White King has moved next to the Rook, not only to\\ndefend it, but also to reduce the mobility of the opposing King. Now {6}\\nWhite mates in three moves thus: 9 R - R 4 ch, K - Kt 8; 10 R -  any square\\non the Rook\\'s file, forcing the Black King in front of the White, K - B 8;\\n11 R - R 1 mate. It has taken eleven moves to mate, and, under any\\nconditions, I believe it should be done in under twenty. While it may be\\nmonotonous, it is worth while for the beginner to practice such things, as\\nit will teach him the proper handling of his pieces.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 3.--Now we come to two Bishops and King against King.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSince the Black King is in the corner, White can play 1 B - Q 3, K - Kt 2;\\n2 B - K Kt 5, K - B 2; 3 B - B 5, and already the Black King is confined to\\na few squares. If the Black King, in the original position, had been in the\\ncentre of the board, or away from the last row, White should have advanced\\nhis King, and then, with the aid of his Bishops, restricted {7} the Black\\nKing\\'s movements to as few squares as possible.\\n\\nWe might now continue: 3...K - Kt 2; 4 K - B 2. In this ending the Black\\nKing must not only be driven to the edge of the board, but he must also be\\nforced into a corner, and, before a mate can be given, the White King must\\nbe brought to the sixth rank and, at the same time, in one of the last two\\nfiles; in this case either K R 6, K Kt 6, K B 7, K B 8, and as K R 6 and\\nK Kt 6 are the nearest squares, it is to either of these squares that the\\nKing ought to go. 4...K - B 2; 5 K - Kt 3, K - Kt 2; 6 K - R 4, K - B 2;\\n7 K - R 5, K - Kt 2; 8 B - Kt 6, K - Kt 1; 9 K - R 6, K - B 1. White must\\nnow mark time and move one of the Bishops, so as to force the Black King to\\ngo back; 10 B - R 5, K - Kt 1; 11 B - K 7, K - R 1. Now the White Bishop\\nmust take up a position from which it can give check next move along the\\nWhite diagonal, when the Black King moves back to Kt 1. 12 B - K Kt 4,\\nK - Kt 1; 13 B - K 6 ch, K - R 1; 14 B - B 6 mate.\\n\\nIt has taken fourteen moves to force the mate and, in any position, it\\nshould be done in under thirty.\\n\\nIn all endings of this kind, care must be taken not to drift into a stale\\nmate.\\n\\nIn this particular ending one should remember that the King must not only\\nbe driven to the edge of the board, but also into a corner. In all such\\nendings, however, it is immaterial whether the King is forced {8} on to the\\nlast rank, or to an outside file, e.g. K R 5 or Q R 4, K 1 or Q 8.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 4.--We now come to Queen and King against King. As the Queen\\ncombines the power of the Rook and the Bishop, it is the easiest mate of\\nall and should always be accomplished in under ten moves. Take the\\nfollowing position:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nA good way to begin is to make the first move with the Queen, trying to\\nlimit the Black King\\'s mobility as much as possible. Thus: 1 Q - B 6,\\nK - Q 5; 2 K - Q 2. Already the Black King has only one available square\\n2...K - K 4; 3 K - K 3, K - B 4; 4 Q - Q 6, K - Kt 4. (Should Black play\\nK - Kt 5, then Q - Kt 6 ch); 5 Q - K 6, K - R 5 (if K - R 4, K - B 4 and\\nmate next move); 6 Q - K Kt 6, K - R 6; 7 K - B 3, K moves; 8 Q mates.\\n\\nIn this ending, as in the case of the Rook, the Black King must be forced\\nto the edge of the board; only {9} the Queen being so much more powerful\\nthan the Rook, the process is far easier and shorter. These are the three\\nelementary endings and in all of these the principle is the same. In each\\ncase the co-operation of the King is needed. In order to force a mate\\nwithout the aid of the King, at least two Rooks are required.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n2. PAWN PROMOTION\\n\\nThe gain of a Pawn is the smallest material advantage that can be obtained\\nin a game; and it often is sufficient to win, even when the Pawn is the\\nonly remaining unit, apart from the Kings. It is essential, speaking\\ngenerally, that\\n\\n_the King should be in front of his Pawn, with at least one intervening\\nsquare_.\\n\\nIf the opposing King is directly in front of the Pawn, then the game cannot\\nbe won. This can best be explained by the following examples.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 5.\\n\\n[Illustration] {10}\\n\\nThe position is drawn, and the way to proceed is for Black to keep the King\\nalways directly in front of the Pawn, and when it cannot be done, as for\\ninstance in this position because of the White King, then the Black King\\nmust be kept in front of the White King. The play would proceed thus:\\n1 P - K 3, K - K 4; 2 K - Q 3, K - Q 4. This is a very important move. Any\\nother move would lose, as will be shown later. As the Black King cannot be\\nkept close up to the Pawn, it must be brought as far forward as possible\\nand, at the same time, in front of the White King.\\n\\n3 P - K 4 ch, K - K 4; 4 K - K 3, K - K 3; 5 K - B 4, K - B 3. Again the\\nsame case. As the White King comes up, the Black King must be kept in front\\nof it, since it cannot be brought up to the Pawn.\\n\\n6 P - K 5 ch, K - K 3; 7 K - K 4, K - K 2; 8 K - Q 5, K - Q 2;\\n9 P - K 6 ch, K - K 2; 10 K - K 5, K - K 1; 11 K - Q 6, K - Q 1. If now\\nWhite advances the Pawn, the Black King gets in front of it and White must\\neither give up the Pawn or play K - K 6, and a stale mate results. If\\ninstead of advancing the Pawn White withdraws his King, Black brings his\\nKing up to the Pawn and, when forced to go back, he moves to K _in front_\\nof the Pawn ready to come up again or to move in front of the White King,\\nas before, should the latter advance.\\n\\nThe whole mode of procedure is very important and the student should become\\nthoroughly conversant {11} with its details; for it involves principles to\\nbe taken up later on, and because many a beginner has lost identical\\npositions from lack of proper knowledge. At this stage of the book I cannot\\nlay too much stress on its importance.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 6.--In this position White wins, as the King is in front of his\\nPawn and there is one intervening square.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe method to follow is to\\n\\n_advance the King as far as is compatible with the safety of the Pawn and\\nnever to advance the Pawn until it is essential to its own safety_.\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n        1. K - K 4, K - K 3.\\n\\nBlack does not allow the White King to advance, therefore White is now\\ncompelled to advance his Pawn so as to force Black to move away. He is then\\nable to advance his own King.\\n\\n        2. P - K3, K - B 3; 3. K - Q 5, K - K 2.\\n\\n{12} If Black had played 3...K - B 4, then White would be forced to advance\\nthe Pawn to K 4, since he could not advance his King without leaving Black\\nthe opportunity to play K - K 5, winning the Pawn. Since he has not done\\nso, it is better for White not to advance the Pawn yet, since its own\\nsafety does not require it, but to try to bring the King still further\\nforward. Thus:\\n\\n        4. K - K 5, K - Q 2; 5. K - B 6, K - K 1.\\n\\nNow the White Pawn is too far back and it may be brought up within\\nprotection of the King.\\n\\n        6. P - K 4, K - Q 2.\\n\\nNow it would not do to play K - B 7, because Black would play K - Q 3, and\\nWhite would have to bring back his King to protect the Pawn. Therefore he\\nmust continue.\\n\\n        7. P - K 5, K - K 1.\\n\\nHad he moved anywhere else, White could have played K - B 7, followed by\\nthe advance of the Pawn to K 6, K 7, K 8; all these squares being protected\\nby the King. As Black tries to prevent that, White must now force him to\\nmove away, at the same time always keeping the King in front of the Pawn.\\nThus:\\n\\n        8. K - K 6.\\n\\nP - K 6 would make it a draw, as Black would then play K - B, and we would\\nhave a position similar to the one explained in connection with Example 5.\\n\\n        8...K - B 1;  9. K - Q 7.\\n\\n{13} King moves and the White Pawn advances to K 8, becomes a Queen, and it\\nis all over.\\n\\nThis ending is like the previous one, and for the same reasons should be\\nthoroughly understood before proceeding any further.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n3. PAWN ENDINGS\\n\\nI shall now give a couple of simple endings of two Pawns against one, or\\nthree against two, that the reader may see how they can be won. Fewer\\nexplanations will be given, as it is up to the student to work things out\\nfor himself. Furthermore, nobody can learn how to play well merely from the\\nstudy of a book; it can only serve as a guide and the rest must be done by\\nthe teacher, if the student has one; if not, the student must realise by\\nlong and bitter experience the practical application of the many things\\nexplained in the book.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 7.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n{14} In this position White cannot win by playing 1 P - B 6, because Black\\nplays, not P x P, which would lose, but 1...K - Kt 1, and if then 2 P x P,\\nK x P, and draws, as shown in a previous case. If 2 P - B 7 ch, K - B 1,\\nand White will never be able to Queen his Pawn without losing it. If\\n2 K - K 7, P x P; 3 K x P, K - B 1, and draws. White, however, can win the\\nposition given in the diagram by playing:\\n\\n1 K - Q 7, K - Kt 1; 2 K - K 7, K - R 1; 3 P - B 6, P x P. If 3...K - Kt 1;\\n4 P - B 7 ch, K - R 1; 5 P - B 8 (Q) mate.\\n\\n4 K - B 7, P - B 4; 5 P - Kt 7 ch, K - R 2; 6 P - Kt 8 (Q) ch, K - R 3;\\n7 Q - Kt 6 mate.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 8.--In the above position White can\\'t win by 1 P - B 5. Black\\'s\\nbest answer would be P - Kt 3 draws. (The student should work this out.) He\\ncannot win by 1 P - Kt 5, because P - Kt 3 draws. (This, because of the\\nprinciple of the \"_opposition_\" {15} which governs this ending as well as\\nall the Pawn-endings already given, and which will be explained more fully\\nlater on.)\\n\\nWhite can win, however, by playing: 1 K - K 4, K - K 3. (If 1...P - Kt 3;\\n2 K - Q 4, K - K 3; 3 K - B 5, K - B 3; 4 K - Q 6, K - B 2; 5 P - Kt 5,\\nK - Kt 2; 6 K - K 7, K - Kt 1; 7 K - B 6, K - R 2; 8 K - B 7 and White wins\\nthe Pawn.)\\n\\n2 P - B 5 ch, K - B 3; 3 K - B 4, P - Kt 3. (If this Pawn is kept back we\\narrive at the ending shown in Example 7.) 4 P - Kt 5 ch, K - B 2;\\n5 P - B 6, K - K 3; 6 K - K 4, K - B 2; 7 K - K 5, K - B 1. White cannot\\nforce his Bishop\\'s Pawn into Q (find out why), but by giving his Pawn up he\\ncan win the other Pawn and the game. Thus:\\n\\n8 P - B 7, K x P; 9 K - Q 6, K - B 1; 10 K - K 6, K - Kt 2; 11 K - K 7,\\nK - Kt 1; 12 K - B 6, K - R 2; 13 K - B 7, K - R 1; 14 K x P , K - Kt 1.\\n\\nThere is still some resistance in Black\\'s position. In fact, the only way\\nto win is the one given here, as will easily be seen by experiment.\\n\\n15 K - R 6 (if K - B 6, K - R 2; and in order to win White must get back to\\nthe actual position, as against 16 P - Kt 6 ch, K - R 1 draws), K - R 1;\\n16 P - Kt 6, K - Kt 1; 17 P - Kt 7, K - B 2; 18 K - R 7, and White queens\\nthe Pawn and wins.\\n\\nThis ending, apparently so simple, should show the student the enormous\\ndifficulties to be surmounted, {16} even when there are hardly any pieces\\nleft, when playing against an adversary who knows how to use the resources\\nat his disposal, and it should show the student, also, the necessity of\\npaying strict attention to these elementary things which form the basis of\\ntrue mastership in Chess.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 9.--In this ending\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite can win by advancing any of the three Pawns on the first move, but it\\nis convenient to follow the general rule, whenever there is no good reason\\nagainst it, of _advancing the Pawn that has no Pawn opposing it_. Thus we\\nbegin by--\\n\\n        1. P - B 5, K - K 2.\\n\\nIf P - Kt 3, P - B 6; and we have a similar ending to one of those shown\\nabove. If 1...P - R 3; 2 P - Kt 5.\\n\\n        2. K - K 5, K - B 2; 3. P - Kt 5, K - K 2.\\n\\n{17} If 3...P - Kt 3; 4 P - B 6, and if 3...P - R 3; 4 P - Kt 6 ch, and in\\neither case we have a similar ending to one of those already shown.\\n\\n        4. P - R 5,\\n\\nand by following it up with P - Kt 6 we have the same ending previously\\nshown. Should Black play 4...P - Kt 3, then R P x P, P x P; P - B 6 ch with\\nthe same result.\\n\\nHaving now seen the cases when the Pawns are all on one side of the board\\nwe shall now examine a case when there are Pawns on both sides of the\\nboard.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 10.--In these cases the general rule is to _act immediately on the\\nside where you have the superior forces_. Thus we have:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        1. P - K Kt 4.\\n\\n{18} It is generally advisable to advance the Pawn that is free from\\nopposition.\\n\\n        1. ........               P - Q R 4.\\n\\nBlack makes an advance on the other side, and now White considers whether\\nor not he should stop the advance. In this case either way wins, but\\ngenerally the advance should be stopped when the opposing King is far away.\\n\\n        2. P - Q R 4, K - B 3; 3. P - R 4, K - K 3.\\n\\nIf 3...K - Kt 3, then simple counting will show that White goes to the\\nother side with his King, wins the P at Q R 4, and then Queens his single\\nPawn long before Black can do the same.\\n\\n        4. P - Kt 5, K - B 2; 5. K - B 5, K - Kt 2; 6. P - R 5, K - B 2.\\n\\nIf 6...P - R 3; 7 P - Kt 6, and then the two Pawns defend themselves and\\nWhite can go to the other side with his King, to win the other Pawn.\\n\\n        7. K - K 5.\\n\\nNow it is time to go to the other side with the King, win the Black Pawn\\nand Queen the single Pawn. This is typical of all such endings and should\\nbe worked out by the student in this case and in similar cases which he can\\nput up. {19}\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n4. SOME WINNING POSITIONS IN THE MIDDLE-GAME\\n\\nBy the time the student has digested all that has been previously\\nexplained, he, no doubt, is anxious to get to the actual game and play with\\nall the pieces. However, before considering the openings, we shall devote a\\nlittle time to some combinations that often arise during the game, and\\nwhich will give the reader some idea of the beauty of the game, once he\\nbecomes better acquainted with it.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 11.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is Black\\'s move, and thinking that White merely threatens to play\\nQ - R 6 and to mate at K Kt 7, Black plays 1 ... R - K 1, threatening mate\\nby way of R - K 8. White now uncovers his real and most effective threat,\\nviz.:\\n\\n1 ... R - K 1; 2 Q x P ch, K x Q; 3 R - R 3 ch, K - Kt 1; 4 R - R 8 mate.\\n{20}\\n\\nThis same type of combination may come as the result of a somewhat more\\ncomplicated position.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 12.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite is a piece behind, and unless he can win it back quickly he will\\nlose; he therefore plays:\\n\\n        1. Kt x Kt                B - Kt 4\\n\\nHe cannot take the Kt because White threatens mate by Q x P ch followed by\\nR - R 3 ch.\\n\\n        2. Kt - K 7 ch            Q x Kt\\n\\nAgain if B x Kt; Q x P ch, K x Q; R - R 3 ch, King moves; R - R 8 mate.\\n\\n        3. R x Q                  B x R\\n        4. Q - Q 7\\n\\nand White wins one of the two Bishops, remains with a Q and a B against a R\\nand B, and should therefore win easily. These two examples show the {21}\\ndanger of advancing the K Kt P one square, after having Castled on that\\nside.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 13.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThis is another very interesting type of combination. Black has a R for a\\nKt and should therefore win, unless White is able to obtain some\\ncompensation immediately. White, in fact, mates in a few moves thus:\\n\\n        1. Kt - B 6 ch            P x Kt\\n\\nForced, otherwise Q X P mates.\\n\\n        2. Q - Kt 3 ch            K - R 1\\n        3. B x P mate.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 14.--The same type of combination occurs in a more complicated form\\nin the following position. {22}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        1. B x Kt                 Q x B.\\n\\nIf ...B x Kt; Q - B 3 threatens mate, and therefore wins the Q, which is\\nalready attacked.\\n\\n        2. Kt - B 6 ch            P x Kt\\n        3. R - Kt 3 ch            K - R 1\\n        4. B x P mate.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 15.--A very frequent type of combination is shown in the following\\nposition.\\n\\n[Illustration] {23}\\n\\nHere White is the exchange and a Pawn behind, but he can win quickly thus:\\n1 B x P ch, K x B. (If 1...K - R 1; 2 Q - K R 5, P - K Kt 3; 3 Q - R 6, and\\nwins.)\\n\\n2 Q - R 5 ch, K - Kt 1; 3 Kt - Kt 5, and Black cannot stop mate at K R 7\\nexcept by sacrificing the Queen by Q - K 5, which would leave White with a\\nQ for a R.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 16.--This same type of combination is seen in a more complicated\\nform in the following position.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite proceeds as follows: 1 Kt x Kt ch (this clears the line for the B);\\nB x Kt (to stop the Kt from moving to Kt 5 after the sacrifice of the B);\\n2 R x B, Kt x R best; 3 B x P ch, K x B. (If 3..K - R 1; 4 Q - R 5,\\nP - K Kt 3; 5 B x P ch, K - Kt 2; 6 Q - R 7 ch, K - B 3; 7 P - Kt 5 ch,\\nK - K 3; 8 B x P ch, R x B; 9 Q - K 4 mate.) 4 Q - R 5 ch, K - Kt 1;\\n5 Kt - Kt 5, R - B 1; {24} 6 Q - R 7 ch, K - B 1; 7 Q - R 8 ch, Kt - Kt 1;\\n8 Kt - R 7 ch, K - K 2; 9 R - K 1 ch, K - Q 1; 10 Q x Kt mate.\\n\\nThis combination is rather long and has many variations, therefore a\\nbeginner will hardly be able to fathom it; but, knowing the type of\\ncombination, he might under similar circumstances undertake and carry out a\\nbrilliant attack which he would otherwise never think of. It will be seen\\nthat all the combinations shown have for a foundation the proper\\nco-ordination of the pieces, which have all been brought to bear against a\\nweak point.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n5. RELATIVE VALUE OF THE PIECES\\n\\nBefore going on to the general principles of the openings, it is advisable\\nto give the student an idea of the proper relative value of the pieces.\\nThere is no complete and accurate table for all of them, and the only thing\\nto do is to compare the pieces separately.\\n\\nFor all general theoretical purposes the Bishop and the Knight have to be\\nconsidered as of the same value, though it is my opinion that the Bishop\\nwill prove the more valuable piece in most cases; and it is well known that\\ntwo Bishops are almost always better than two Knights.\\n\\nThe Bishop will be stronger against Pawns than the Knight, and in\\ncombination with Pawns will also be stronger against the Rook than the\\nKnight will be. {25}\\n\\nA Bishop and a Rook are also stronger than a Knight and a Rook, but a Queen\\nand a Knight may be stronger than a Queen and a Bishop.\\n\\nA Bishop will often be worth more than three Pawns, but a Knight very\\nseldom so, and may even not be worth so much.\\n\\nA Rook will be worth a Knight and two Pawns, or a Bishop and two Pawns,\\nbut, as said before, the Bishop will be a better piece against the Rook.\\n\\nTwo Rooks are slightly stronger than a Queen. They are slightly weaker than\\ntwo Knights and a Bishop, and a little more so than two Bishops and a\\nKnight. The power of the Knight decreases as the pieces are changed off.\\nThe power of the Rook, on the contrary, increases.\\n\\nThe King, a purely _defensive_ piece throughout the middle-game, becomes an\\n_offensive_ piece once all the pieces are off the board, and sometimes even\\nwhen there are one or two minor pieces left. The handling of the King\\nbecomes of paramount importance once the end-game stage is reached.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n6. GENERAL STRATEGY OF THE OPENING\\n\\nThe main thing is to _develop the pieces quickly_. Get them into play as\\nfast as you can.\\n\\nFrom the outset two moves, 1 P - K 4  or 1 P - Q 4, open up lines for the\\nQueen and a Bishop. Therefore, theoretically one of these two moves must be\\nthe best, as no other first move accomplishes so much. {26}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 17.--Suppose we begin:\\n\\n        1. P - K 4                P - K 4\\n        2. Kt - K B 3\\n\\nThis is both an attacking and a developing move. Black can now either reply\\nwith the identical move or play\\n\\n        2. ........               Kt - Q B 3\\n\\nThis developing move at the same time defends the King\\'s Pawn.\\n\\n        3. Kt - B 3               Kt - B 3\\n\\nThese moves are of a purely developing nature.\\n\\n        4. B - Kt 5\\n\\n_It is generally advisable not to bring this Bishop out until one Knight is\\nout_, preferably the King\\'s Knight. The Bishop could also have been played\\nto B 4, but it is advisable whenever possible to combine development and\\nattack.\\n\\n        4. ........               B - Kt 5\\n\\nBlack replies in the same manner, threatening a possible exchange of Bishop\\nfor Knight with Kt x P to follow.\\n\\n        5. O - O\\n\\nan indirect way of preventing 5...B x Kt, which more experience or study\\nwill show to be bad. At the same time _the Rook is brought into action in\\nthe centre, a very important point_. {27}\\n\\n        5. ........               O - O\\n\\nBlack follows the same line of reasoning.\\n\\n        6. P - Q 3                P - Q 3\\n\\nThese moves have a two-fold object, viz.: to protect the King\\'s Pawn and to\\nopen the diagonal for the development of the Queen\\'s Bishop.\\n\\n        7. B - Kt 5\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nA very powerful move, which brings us to the middle-game stage, as there is\\nalready in view a combination to win quickly by Kt - Q 5. This threat makes\\nit impossible for Black to continue the same course. (There is a long\\nanalysis showing that Black should lose if he also plays B - Kt 5.) He is\\nnow forced to play 7...B x Kt, as experience has shown, thus bringing up to\\nnotice three things.\\n\\nFirst, the complete development of the opening has taken only seven moves.\\n(This varies up to ten or twelve moves in some very exceptional cases. As a\\nrule, eight should be enough.) Second, Black has {28} been compelled to\\nexchange a Bishop for a Knight, but as a compensation he has isolated\\nWhite\\'s Q R P and doubled a Pawn. (This, at such an early stage of the\\ngame, is rather an advantage for White, as the Pawn is doubled towards the\\ncentre of the board.) Third, White by the exchange brings up a Pawn to\\ncontrol the square Q 4, puts Black on the defensive, as experience will\\nshow, and thus keeps _the initiative_, an unquestionable advantage.[1]\\n\\nThe strategical principles expounded above are the same for all the\\nopenings, only their tactical application varies according to the\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nBefore proceeding further I wish to lay stress on the following point which\\nthe student should bear in mind.\\n\\n_Before development has been completed no piece should be moved more than\\nonce, unless it is essential in order to obtain either material advantage\\nor to secure freedom of action._\\n\\nThe beginner would do well to remember this, as well as what has already\\nbeen stated: viz., _bring out the Knights before bringing out the Bishops_.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n7. CONTROL OF THE CENTRE\\n\\nThe four squares, K 4 and Q 4 on each side respectively, are the centre\\nsquares, and control of these squares is called control of the centre. _The\\ncontrol of the centre is of great importance._ No violent attack can\\nsucceed without controlling at least two of these {29} squares, and\\npossibly three. Many a manoeuvre in the opening has for its sole object the\\ncontrol of the centre, which invariably ensures the initiative. It is well\\nalways to bear this in mind, since it will often be the reason of a series\\nof moves which could not otherwise be properly understood. As this book\\nprogresses I shall dwell more fully on these different points. At present I\\nshall devote some time to openings taken at random and explain the moves\\naccording to general principles. The student will in that way train his\\nmind in the proper direction, and will thus have less trouble in finding a\\nway out when confronted with a new and difficult situation.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 18.\\n\\n        1. P - K 4                P - K 4\\n        2. Kt - K B 3             P - Q 3\\n\\nA timid move. Black assumes a defensive attitude at once. On principle the\\nmove is wrong. In the openings, whenever possible, _pieces should be moved\\nin preference to Pawns_.\\n\\n        3. P - Q 4\\n\\nWhite takes the offensive immediately and strives to control the centre so\\nas to have ample room to deploy his forces.\\n\\n        3. ........               Kt - Q 2\\n\\nBlack does not wish to relinquish the centre and also prefers the text move\\nto Kt - Q B 3, which would be the more natural square for the Kt. But on\\n{30} principle the move is wrong, because it blocks the action of the\\nQueen\\'s Bishop, and instead of facilitating the action of Black\\'s pieces,\\ntends, on the contrary, to cramp them.\\n\\n        4. B - Q B 4              P - K R 3\\n\\nBlack is forced to pay the penalty of his previous move. Such a move on\\nBlack\\'s part condemns by itself any form of opening that makes it\\nnecessary. White threatened Kt - Kt 5 and Black could not stop it with\\n4...B - K 2, because of 5 P x P, Kt x P (if 5...P x P, 6 Q - Q 5);\\n6 Kt x Kt, P x Kt; 7 Q - R 5, and White wins a Pawn and has besides a\\nperfectly safe position.\\n\\n        5. Kt - B 3               K Kt - B 3\\n        6. B - K 3                B - K 2\\n        7. Q - K 2\\n\\nIt should be noticed that White does not Castle yet. The reason is that he\\nwants to deploy his forces first, and through the last move force Black to\\nplay P - Q B 3 to make room for the Queen as White threatens R - Q 1, to be\\nfollowed by P x P. Black\\'s other alternatives would finally force him to\\nplay P x P, thus abandoning the centre to White.\\n\\n        7. ........               P - B 3\\n        8. R - Q 1                Q - B 2\\n        9. O - O\\n\\nWith this last move White completes his development, while Black is\\nevidently somewhat hampered. A simple examination will suffice to show that\\nWhite\\'s position {31} is unassailable. There are no weak spots in his\\narmour, and his pieces are ready for any manoeuvre that he may wish to\\ncarry out in order to begin the attack on the enemy\\'s position. The student\\nshould carefully study this example. It will show him that it is sometimes\\nconvenient to delay Castling. I have given the moves as they come to my\\nmind without following any standard book on openings. Whether the moves\\ngiven by me agree or not with the standard works, I do not know, but at the\\npresent stage of this book it is not convenient to enter into discussions\\nof mere technicalities which the student will be able to understand when he\\nhas become more proficient.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 19.\\n\\n        1. P - K 4                P - K 4\\n        2. Kt - K B 3             P - Q 3\\n        3. P - Q 4                B - Kt 5\\n\\nA bad move, which violates one of the principles set down, according to\\nwhich at least one Knight should be developed before the Bishops are\\nbrought out, and also because it exchanges a Bishop for a Knight, which in\\nthe opening is generally bad, unless there is some compensation.\\n\\n        4. P x P                  B x Kt\\n\\n4...P x P loses a Pawn.\\n\\n        5. Q x B                  P x P\\n        6. B - Q B 4              Q - B 3\\n\\nIf Kt - B 3; Q - Q Kt 3 wins a Pawn.\\n\\n{32} /*    7. Q - Q Kt 3 P - Q Kt 3    8. Kt - B 3 P - Q B 3 */\\n\\nTo prevent Kt - Q 5.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nBlack, however, has no pieces out except his Queen, and White, with a\\nBishop and a Knight already developed, has a chance of obtaining an\\nadvantage quickly by playing Kt - Q 5 anyway. The student is left to work\\nout the many variations arising from this position.\\n\\nThese examples will show the practical application of the principles\\npreviously enunciated. The student is warned against playing Pawns in\\npreference to pieces at the beginning of the game, especially P - K R 3 and\\nP - Q R 3, which are moves very commonly indulged in by beginners.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n8. TRAPS\\n\\nI shall now give a few positions or traps to be avoided in the openings,\\nand in which (practice has shown) beginners are often caught. {33}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 20.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite plays:\\n\\n        1. P x P                  Kt x P\\n\\nBlack should have recaptured with the Pawn.\\n\\n        2. Kt x Kt                B x Q\\n        3. B x P ch               K - K 2\\n        4. Kt - Q 5 mate.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n{34} Black, having the move, should play P - K 3. But suppose he plays\\nKt - K B 3 instead, then comes--\\n\\n        1. B x P ch\\n\\nKt - K 5 would also give White the advantage, the threat being of course if\\nB x Q; 2 B x P mate. Nor does B - R 5 help matters, because of 2 Q x B,\\n1... B - K 3 leaves Black with the inferior position. But White\\'s move in\\nthe text secures an immediate material advantage, and the beginner at any\\nrate should never miss such an opportunity for the sake of a speculative\\nadvantage in position.\\n\\n        1. ........               K x B\\n        2. Kt - K 5 ch            K moves\\n        3. Kt x B\\n\\nand White has won a Pawn besides having the better position.\\n\\nThere are a good many other traps--in fact, there is a book written on\\ntraps on the chess board; but the type given above is the most common of\\nall.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{35}\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nFURTHER PRINCIPLES IN END-GAME PLAY\\n\\nWe shall now go back to the endings in search of a few more principles,\\nthen again to the middle-game, and finally to the openings once more, so\\nthat the advance may not only be gradual but homogeneous. In this way the\\nfoundation on which we expect to build the structure will be firm and\\nsolid.\\n\\n9. A CARDINAL PRINCIPLE\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIn the position shown above, White can draw by playing P - Kt 4 according\\nto the general rule that governs such cases, i.e. _to advance the Pawn that\\nis free from opposition_. But suppose that White, either because he does\\nnot know this principle or because he {36} does not, in this case,\\nsufficiently appreciate the value of its application; suppose, we say, that\\nhe plays 1 P - Q R 4. Then Black can win by playing 1... P - Q R 4,\\napplying one of the cardinal principles of the high strategy of chess--\\n\\n        _A unit that holds two._\\n\\nIn this case one Pawn would hold two of the opponent\\'s Pawns. The student\\ncannot lay too much stress on this principle. It can be applied in many\\nways, and it constitutes one of the principal weapons in the hands of a\\nmaster.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 22.--The example given should be sufficient proof. We give a few\\nmoves of the main variation:--\\n\\n        1. P - R 4                P - Q R 4\\n        2. K - Kt 2               K - B 5\\n            (Best; see why.)\\n        3. P - Kt 4               P x P\\n            (Best.)\\n        4. P - R 5                P - Kt 6\\n        5. P - R 6                P - Kt 7\\n        6. P - R 7                P - Kt 8 (Q)\\n        7. P - R 8 (Q)            Q - K 5 ch\\n        8. Q x Q                  K x Q\\n\\nThis brings the game to a position which is won by Black, and which\\nconstitutes one of the classical endings of King and Pawns. I shall try to\\nexplain the guiding idea of it to those not familiar with it. {37}\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n10. A CLASSICAL ENDING\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 23.--In this position White\\'s best line of defence consists in\\nkeeping his Pawn where it stands at R 2. As soon as the Pawn is advanced it\\nbecomes easier for Black to win. On the other hand, Black\\'s plan to win\\n(supposing that White does not advance his Pawn) may be divided into three\\nparts. The first part will be to get his King to K R 6, at the same time\\nkeeping intact the position of his Pawns. (This is all important, since, in\\norder to win the game, it is essential at the end that Black may be able to\\nadvance his rearmost Pawn one or two squares according to the position of\\nthe White King.)\\n\\n        1. K - Kt 3               K - K 6\\n        2. K - Kt 2\\n\\nIf 2 K - Kt 4, K - B 7; 3 P - R 4, P - Kt 3 will win. {38}\\n\\n        2. ........               K - B 5\\n        3. K - B 2                K - Kt 5\\n        4. K - Kt 2               K - R 5\\n        5. K - Kt 1               K - R 6\\n\\nThe first part has been completed.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe second part will be short and will consist in advancing the R P up the\\nK.\\n\\n        6. K - R 1                P - R 4\\n        7. K - Kt 1               P - R 5\\n\\nThis ends the second part.\\n\\n[Illustration] {39}\\n\\nThe third part will consist in timing the advance of the Kt P so as to play\\nP - Kt 6 when the White King is at R 1. It now becomes evident how\\nnecessary it is to be able to move the Kt P either one or two squares\\naccording to the position of the White King, as indicated previously.[2] In\\nthis case, as it is White\\'s move, the Pawn will be advanced two squares\\nsince the White King will be in the corner, but if it were now Black\\'s move\\nthe Kt P should only be advanced one square since the White King is at\\nKt 1.\\n\\n        8. K - R 1                P - Kt 4\\n        9. K - Kt 1               P - Kt 5\\n       10. K - R 1                P - Kt 6\\n       11. P x P\\n\\nIf K - Kt 1, P - Kt 7.\\n\\n       11. ........               P x P\\n       12. K - Kt 1               P - Kt 7\\n       13. K - B 2                K - R 7\\n\\nand wins.\\n\\nIt is in this analytical way that the student should try to learn. He will\\nthus train his mind to follow a logical sequence in reasoning out any\\nposition. This example is excellent training, since it is easy to divide it\\ninto three stages and to explain the main point of each part.\\n\\nThe next subject we shall study is the simple {40} opposition, but before\\nwe devote our time to it I wish to call attention to two things.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n11. OBTAINING A PASSED PAWN\\n\\nWhen three or more Pawns are opposed to each other in some such position as\\nthe one in Example 24, there is always a chance for one side or the other\\nof obtaining a passed Pawn.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 24.--In the above position the way of obtaining a passed Pawn is to\\nadvance the centre Pawn.\\n\\n        1. P - Kt 6               R P x P\\n  If B P x P; P - R 6,\\n        2. P - B 6                P x B P\\n        3. P - R 6\\n\\nand as in this case the White Pawn is nearer to Queen than any of the Black\\nPawns, White will {41} win. Now if it had been Black\\'s move Black could\\nplay\\n\\n        1. ........               P - Kt 3\\n        2. B P x P                B P x P\\n\\nIt would not be advisable to try to obtain a passed Pawn because the White\\nPawns would be nearer to Queen than the single Black Pawn.\\n\\n        3. P x P                  P x P\\n\\nand the game properly played would be a draw. The student should work this\\nout for himself.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n12. HOW TO FIND OUT WHICH PAWN WILL BE FIRST TO QUEEN\\n\\nWhen two Pawns are free, or will be free, to advance to Queen, you can find\\nout, by counting, which Pawn will be the first to succeed.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 25.--In this position whoever moves first wins.\\n\\n[Illustration] {42}\\n\\nThe first thing is to find out, by counting, whether the opposing King can\\nbe in time to stop the passed Pawn from Queening. When, as in this case, it\\ncannot be done, the point is to count which Pawn comes in first. In this\\ncase the time is the same, but the Pawn that reaches the eighth square\\nfirst and becomes a Queen is in a position to capture the adversary\\'s Queen\\nwhen he makes one. Thus:\\n\\n        1. P - R 4                P - K R 4\\n        2. P - R 5                P - R 5\\n        3. P - Kt 6               P x P\\n\\nNow comes a little calculation. White can capture the Pawn, but if he does\\nso, he will not, when Queening, command the square where Black will also\\nQueen his Pawn. Therefore, instead of taking, he plays:\\n\\n        4. P - R 6                P - R 6\\n        5. P - R 7                P - R 7\\n        6. P - R 8 (Q), and wins.\\n\\nThe student would do well to acquaint himself with various simple endings\\nof this sort, so as to acquire the habit of counting, and thus be able to\\nknow with ease when he can or cannot get there first. Once again I must\\ncall attention to the fact that a book cannot by itself teach how to play.\\nIt can only serve as a guide, and the rest must be learned by experience,\\nand if a teacher can be had at the same time, so much the faster will the\\nstudent be able to learn. {43}\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n13. THE OPPOSITION\\n\\nWhen Kings have to be moved, and one player can, by force, bring his King\\ninto a position similar to the one shown in the following diagram, so that\\nhis adversary is forced to move and make way for him, the player obtaining\\nthat advantage is said to have _the opposition_.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 26.--Suppose in the above position White plays\\n\\n        1. K - Q 4\\n\\nNow Black has the option of either opposing the passage of the White King\\nby playing K - Q 3 or, if he prefers, he can _pass_ with his own King by\\nreplying K - B 4. Notice that the Kings are directly opposed to each other,\\nand the number of intervening squares between them is odd--one in this\\ncase.\\n\\nThe opposition can take the form shown above, {44} which can be called\\nactual or close frontal opposition; or this form:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nwhich can be called actual or close diagonal opposition, or, again, this\\nform:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nwhich can be called actual or close lateral opposition.\\n\\nIn practice they are all one and the same. The Kings are always on squares\\nof the same colour, there is only one intervening square between the Kings,\\nand the player who has moved last \"_has the opposition_.\" {45}\\n\\nNow, if the student will take the trouble of moving each King backwards as\\nin a game in the same frontal, diagonal or lateral line respectively shown\\nin the diagrams, we shall have what may be called _distant_ frontal,\\ndiagonal and lateral opposition respectively.\\n\\nThe matter of the opposition is highly important, and takes at times\\nsomewhat complicated forms, all of which can be solved mathematically; but,\\nfor the present, the student should only consider the most simple forms.\\n(An examination of some of the examples of King and Pawns endings already\\ngiven will show several cases of close opposition.)\\n\\nIn all simple forms of opposition,\\n\\n_when the Kings are on the same line and the number of intervening squares\\nbetween them is even, the player who has the move has the opposition_.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 27.--The above position shows to advantage the enormous value of\\nthe opposition. The {46} position is very simple. Very little is left on\\nthe board, and the position, to a beginner, probably looks absolutely even.\\nIt is not the case, however. _Whoever has the move wins._ Notice that the\\nKings are directly in front of one another, and that the number of\\nintervening squares is _even_.\\n\\nNow as to the procedure to win such a position. The proper way to begin is\\nto move straight up. Thus:\\n\\n        1. K - K 2                K - K 2\\n        2. K - K 3                K - K 3\\n        3. K - K 4                K - B 3\\n\\nNow White can exercise the option of either playing K - Q 5 and thus\\npassing with his King, or of playing K - B 4 and prevent the Black King\\nfrom passing, thereby keeping the opposition. Mere counting will show that\\nthe former course will only lead to a draw, therefore White takes the\\nlatter course and plays:\\n\\n        4. K - B 4                K - Kt 3\\n\\nIf 4...K - K 3; 5 K - Kt 5 will win.\\n\\n        5. K - K 5                K - Kt 2\\n\\nNow by counting it will be seen that White wins by capturing Black\\'s Knight\\nPawn.\\n\\nThe process has been comparatively simple in the variation given above, but\\nBlack has other lines of {47} defence more difficult to overcome. Let us\\nbegin anew.\\n\\n        1. K - K 2                K - Q 1\\n\\nNow if 2 K - Q 3, K - Q 2, or if 2 K - K 3, K - K 2, and Black obtains the\\nopposition in both cases. (When the Kings are directly in front of one\\nanother, and the number of intervening squares between the Kings is _odd_,\\nthe player who has moved last has the opposition.)\\n\\nNow in order to win, the White King must advance. There is only one other\\nsquare where he can go, B 3, and that is the right place. Therefore it is\\nseen that in such cases when the opponent makes a so-called waiting move,\\nyou must advance, leaving a rank or file free between the Kings. Therefore\\nwe have--\\n\\n        2. K - B 3                K - K 2\\n\\nNow, it would be bad to advance, because then Black, by bringing up his\\nKing in front of your King, would obtain the opposition. It is White\\'s turn\\nto play a similar move to Black\\'s first move, viz.:\\n\\n        3. K - K 3\\n\\nwhich brings the position back to the first variation shown. The student\\nwould do well to familiarise himself with the handling of the King in all\\nexamples of opposition. It often means the winning or losing of a game.\\n\\n{48} EXAMPLE 28.--The following position is an excellent proof of the value\\nof the opposition as a means of defence.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite is a Pawn behind and apparently lost, yet he can manage to draw as\\nfollows:\\n\\n        1. K - R 1 !\\n\\nThe position of the Pawns does not permit White to draw by means of the\\nactual or close opposition, hence he takes the distant opposition: in\\neffect if 1 K - B 1 (actual or close opposition), K - Q 7; 2 K - B 2,\\nK - Q 6 and White cannot continue to keep the lateral opposition essential\\nto his safety, because of his own Pawn at B 3. On the other hand, after the\\ntext move, if\\n\\n        1. ........               K - Q 7\\n        2. K - R 2                K - Q 6\\n        3. K - R 3 !              K - K 7\\n  {49}\\n        4. K - Kt 2               K - K 6\\n        5. K - Kt 3               K - Q 5\\n        6. K - Kt 4\\n\\nattacking the Pawn and forcing Black to play 6... K - K 6 when he can go\\nback to Kt 3 as already shown, and always keep the opposition.\\n\\nGoing back to the original position, if\\n\\n        1. K - R 1                P - Kt 5\\n\\nWhite does not play P x P, because P - K 5 will win, but plays:\\n\\n        2. K - Kt 2               K - Q 7\\n\\nIf 2...P x P ch; 3 K x P, followed by K - K 4, will draw.\\n\\n        3. P x P                  P - K 5\\n\\nand mere counting will show that both sides Queen, drawing the game.\\n\\nIf the student will now take the trouble to go back to the examples of King\\nand Pawns which I have given in this book,[3] he will realise that in all\\nof them the matter of the opposition is of paramount importance; as, in\\nfact, it is in nearly all endings of King and Pawns, except in such cases\\nwhere the Pawn-position in itself ensures the win.\\n\\n{50}\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n14. THE RELATIVE VALUE OF KNIGHT AND BISHOP\\n\\nBefore turning our attention to this matter it is well to state now that\\n_two Knights alone cannot mate_, but, under certain conditions of course,\\nthey can do so if the opponent has one or more Pawns.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 29.--In the above position White cannot win, although the Black\\nKing is cornered, but in the following position, in which Black has a Pawn,\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite wins with or without the move. Thus:\\n\\n        1. Kt - Kt 6              P - R 5\\n\\n{51} White cannot take the Pawn because the game will be drawn, as\\nexplained before.\\n\\n        2. Kt - K 5               P - R 6\\n        3. Kt - B 6               P - R 7\\n        4. Kt - Kt 5              P - R 8 (Q)\\n        5. Kt - B 7 mate\\n\\nThe reason for this peculiarity in chess is evident.\\n\\n_White with the two Knights can only stalemate the King, unless Black has a\\nPawn which can be moved._\\n\\nEXAMPLE 30.--Although he is a Bishop and a Pawn ahead the following\\nposition cannot be won by White.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is the greatest weakness of the Bishop, that when the Rook\\'s Pawn Queens\\non a square of opposite colour and the opposing King is in front of the\\nPawn, the Bishop is absolutely worthless. All that Black has to do is to\\nkeep moving his King close to the corner square. {52}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 31.--In the above position White with or without the move can win.\\nTake the most difficult variation.\\n\\n        1. ........               K - R 7\\n        2. Kt - Kt 4 ch           K - R 8\\n        3. K - B 1                P - Kt 4\\n        4. K - B 2                P - R 7\\n        5. Kt - K 3               P - Kt 5\\n        6. Kt - B 1               P - Kt 6 ch\\n        7. Kt x P mate\\n\\nNow that we have seen these exceptional cases, we can analyse the different\\nmerits and the relative value of the Knight and the Bishop.\\n\\nIt is generally thought by amateurs that the Knight is the more valuable\\npiece of the two, the chief reason being that, unlike the Bishop, the\\nKnight can command both Black and White squares. However, the fact is\\ngenerally overlooked that the Knight, at any one time, {53} has the choice\\nof one colour only. It takes much longer to bring a Knight from one wing to\\nthe other. Also, as shown in the following Example, a Bishop can stalemate\\na Knight; a compliment which the Knight is unable to return.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 32.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe weaker the player the more terrible the Knight is to him, but as a\\nplayer increases in strength the value of the Bishop becomes more evident\\nto him, and of course there is, or should be, a corresponding decrease in\\nhis estimation of the value of the Knight as compared to the Bishop. In\\nthis respect, as in many others, the masters of to-day are far ahead of the\\nmasters of former generations. While not so long ago some of the very best\\namongst them, like Pillsbury and Tchigorin, preferred Knights to Bishops,\\nthere is hardly a master of to-day who would not completely agree with the\\nstatements made above. {54}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 33.--This is about the only case when the Knight is more valuable\\nthan the Bishop.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is what is called a \"_block position_,\" and all the Pawns are on one\\nside of the board. (If there were Pawns on both sides of the board there\\nwould be no advantage in having a Knight.) In such a position Black has\\nexcellent chances of winning. Of course, there is an extra source of\\nweakness for White in having his Pawns on the same colour-squares as his\\nBishop. This is a mistake often made by players. The proper way, generally,\\nin an ending, is to have your Pawns on squares of opposite colour to that\\nof your own Bishop. When you have your Pawns on squares of the same colour\\nthe action of your own Bishop is limited by them, and consequently the\\nvalue of the Bishop is diminished, since the value of a piece can often be\\nmeasured by the number of squares it commands. While on this subject, I\\nshall also call attention to the {55} fact that it is generally preferable\\nto keep your Pawns on squares of the same colour as that of the opposing\\nBishop, particularly if they are passed Pawns supported by the King. The\\nprinciples might be stated thus:\\n\\n_When the opponent has a Bishop, keep your Pawns on squares of the same\\ncolour as your opponent\\'s Bishop._\\n\\n_Whenever you have a Bishop, whether the opponent has also one or not, keep\\nyour Pawns on squares of the opposite colour to that of your own Bishop._\\n\\nNaturally, these principles have sometimes to be modified to suit the\\nexigencies of the position.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 34.--In the following position the Pawns are on one side of the\\nboard, and there is no advantage in having either a Knight or a Bishop. The\\ngame should surely end in a draw.\\n\\n[Illustration] {56}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 35.--Now let us add three Pawns on each side to the above position,\\nso that there are Pawns on both sides of the board.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is now preferable to have the Bishop, though the position, if properly\\nplayed out, should end in a draw. The advantage of having the Bishop lies\\nas much in its ability to command, at long range, both sides of the board\\nfrom a central position as in its ability to move quickly from one side of\\nthe board to the other.\\n\\n[Illustration] {57}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 36.--In the above position it is unquestionably an advantage to\\nhave the Bishop, because, although each player has the same number of\\nPawns, they are not balanced on each side of the board. Thus, on the King\\'s\\nside, White has three to two, while on the Queen\\'s side it is Black that\\nhas three to two. Still, with proper play, the game should end in a draw,\\nthough White has somewhat better chances.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 37.--Here is a position in which to have the Bishop is a decided\\nadvantage, since not only are there Pawns on both sides of the board, but\\nthere is a passed Pawn (K R P for White, Q R P for Black). Black should\\nhave extreme difficulty in drawing this position, if he can do it at all.\\n{58}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 38.--Again Black would have great difficulty in drawing this\\nposition.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe student should carefully consider these positions. I hope that the many\\nexamples will help him to understand, in their true value, the relative\\nmerits of the Knight and Bishop. As to the general method of procedure, a\\nteacher, or practical experience, will be best. I might say generally,\\nhowever, that the proper course in these endings, as in all similar\\nendings, is: Advance of the King to the centre of the board or towards the\\npassed Pawns, or Pawns that are susceptible of being attacked, and rapid\\nadvance of the passed Pawn or Pawns as far as is consistent with their\\nsafety.\\n\\nTo give a fixed line of play would be folly. Each ending is different, and\\nrequires different handling, according to what the adversary proposes to\\ndo. Calculation by visualising the future positions is what will count.\\n{59}\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n15. HOW TO MATE WITH A KNIGHT AND A BISHOP\\n\\nNow, before going back again to the middle-game and the openings, let us\\nsee how to mate with Knight and Bishop, and, then, how to win with a Queen\\nagainst a Rook.\\n\\nWith a Knight and a Bishop _the mate can only be given in the corners of\\nthe same colour as the Bishop_.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 39.--In this example we must mate either at Q R 1 or K R 8. The\\nending can be divided into two parts. Part one consists in driving the\\nBlack King to the last line. We might begin, as is generally done in all\\nsuch cases, by advancing the King to the centre of the board:\\n\\n        1. K - K 2                K - Q 2\\n\\nBlack, in order to make it more difficult, goes towards the white-squared\\ncorner:\\n\\n        2. K - Q 3                K - B 3\\n        3. B - B 4                K - Q 4\\n  {60}\\n        4. Kt - K 2               K - B 4\\n        5. Kt - B 3               K - Kt 5\\n        6. K - Q 4                K - R 4\\n        7. K - B 5                K - R 3\\n        8. K - B 6                K - R 2\\n        9. Kt - Q 5               K - R 1\\n\\nThe first part is now over; the Black King is in the white-squared corner.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe second and last part will consist in driving the Black King now from\\nQ R 8 to Q R 1 or K R 8 in order to mate him. Q R 1 will be the quickest in\\nthis position.\\n\\n       10. Kt - Kt 6 ch           K - R 2\\n       11. B - B 7                K - R 3\\n       12. B - Kt 8               K - R 4\\n       13. Kt - Q 5               K - R 5\\n\\nBlack tries to make for K R 1 with his King. White has two ways to prevent\\nthat, one by 14 B - K 5, {61} K - Kt 6; 15 Kt - K 3, and the other which I\\ngive as the text, and which I consider better for the student to learn,\\nbecause it is more methodical and more in accord with the spirit of all\\nthese endings, _by using the King as much as possible_.\\n\\n       14. K - B 5 !              K - Kt 6\\n       15. Kt - Kt 4              K - B 6\\n       16. B - B 4                K - Kt 6\\n       17. B - K 5                K - R 5\\n       18. K - B 4                K - R 4\\n       19. B - B 7 ch             K - R 5\\n       20. Kt - Q 3               K - R 6\\n       21. B - Kt 6               K - R 5\\n       22. Kt - Kt 2 ch           K - R 6\\n       23. K - B 3                K - R 7\\n       24. K - B 2                K - R 6\\n       25. B - B 5 ch             K - R 7\\n       26. Kt - Q 3               K - R 8\\n       27. B - Kt 4               K - R 7\\n       28. Kt - B 1 ch            K - R 8\\n       29. B - B 3 mate\\n\\nIt will be seen that the ending is rather laborious. There are two\\noutstanding features: the close following by the King, and the controlling\\nof the squares of opposite colour to the Bishop by the combined action of\\nthe Knight and King. The student would do well to exercise himself\\nmethodically in this ending, as it gives a very good idea of the actual\\npower of the pieces, and it requires foresight in order to accomplish the\\n{62} mate within the fifty moves which are granted by the rules.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n16. QUEEN AGAINST ROOK\\n\\nThis is one of the most difficult endings without Pawns. The resources of\\nthe defence are many, and when used skilfully only a very good player will\\nprevail within the limit of fifty moves allowed by the rules. (The rule is\\nthat at any moment you may demand that your opponent mate you within fifty\\nmoves. However, every time a piece is exchanged or a Pawn advanced the\\ncounting must begin afresh.)\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 40.--This is one of the standard positions which Black can often\\nbring about. Now, it is White\\'s move. If it were Black\\'s move it would be\\nsimple, as he would have to move his Rook away from the King (find out\\nwhy), and then the Rook would be {63} comparatively easy to win. We deduce\\nfrom the above that the main object is to force the Black Rook away from\\nthe defending King, and that, in order to compel Black to do so, we must\\nbring about the position in the diagram with _Black_ to move. Once we know\\nwhat is required, the way to proceed becomes easier to find. Thus:\\n\\n        1. Q - K 5 ch\\n\\nNot 1 Q - R 6, because R - B 2 ch; 2 K - Kt 6, R - B 3 ch; 3 K x R.\\nStalemate. (The beginner will invariably fall into this trap.)\\n\\n        1. ........               K to R 1 or to R 2\\n        2. Q - R 1 ch             K - Kt 1\\n        3. Q - R 5\\n\\nIn a few moves we have accomplished our object. The first part is\\nconcluded. Now we come to the second part. The Rook can only go to a White\\nsquare, otherwise the first check with the Queen will win it. Therefore\\n\\n        3. ........               R - Kt 6\\n        4. Q - K 5 ch             K - R 1 best\\n        5. Q - R 8 ch             K - R 2\\n        6. Q - Kt 7 ch            K - R 1\\n        7. Q - Kt 8 ch            R - Kt 1\\n        8. Q - R 2 mate\\n\\n(The student should find out by himself how to win when 3...R - Kt 8;\\n4 Q - K 5 ch, K - R 2.) {64}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 41.--The procedure here is very similar. The things to bear in mind\\nare that the Rook must be prevented from interposing at Kt 1 because of an\\nimmediate mate, and in the same way the King must be prevented from going\\neither to R 3 or B 1.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 42.--We shall now examine a more difficult position.\\n\\n[Illustration] {65}\\n\\nMany players would be deceived by this position. The most likely looking\\nmove is not the best. Thus suppose we begin\\n\\n        1. Q - K 5 ch             K - B 1\\n        2. K - Kt 6               R - Q 2\\n\\nThe only defence, but, unfortunately, a very effective one, which makes it\\nvery difficult for White, since he cannot play 3 Q - K 6 because of\\n3...R - Kt 2 ch; 4 K - B 6, R - Kt 3 ch draws. Nor can he win quickly by\\n3 Q - Q B 5 ch because 3...K - K 1, 4 K - B 6, R - Q 3 ch ! driving back\\nthe White King.\\n\\nNow that we have seen the difficulties of the situation let us go back. The\\nbest move is\\n\\n        1. Q - Kt 5 ch !          K - R 1\\n\\nIf K - R 2; 2 Q - Kt 6 ch, K - R 1; 3 K - R 6 !\\n\\n        2. Q - K 5 ch !           K - R 2 best\\n        3. K - Kt 5               R - R 2 ! best\\n\\nIf 3...R - Kt 2 ch; 4 K - B 6 leads to a position similar to those in\\nExamples 40 and 41.\\n\\n        4. Q - K 4 ch             K - Kt 1\\n        5. Q - B 4 ch             K - R 2\\n        6. K - B 6                R - K Kt 2\\n        7. Q - R 4 ch             K - Kt 1\\n        8. Q - R 5\\n\\n{66} and we have the position of Example 40 with Black to move.\\n\\nLet us go back again.\\n\\n        1. Q - Kt 5 ch            K - B 1\\n        2. Q - Q 8 ch             K - Kt 2\\n        3. K - Kt 5               R - B 6\\n\\nThe best place for the Rook away from the King. 3...K - R 2; 4 Q - Q 4,\\nR - Kt 2 ch; 5 K - B 6 would lead to positions similar to those already\\nseen.\\n\\n        4. Q - Q 4 ch             K - B 1\\n        5. K - Kt 6\\n\\n5 Q - Q 6 ch, K - Kt 2; 6 Q - K 5 ch, K - B 1; 7 K - Kt 6 would also win\\nthe Rook. The text move, however, is given to show the finesse of such\\nendings. White now threatens mate at Q 8.\\n\\n        5. ........               R - Kt 6 ch\\n        6. K - B 6                R - B 6 ch\\n        7. K - K 6                R - K R 6\\n\\nWhite threatened mate at K R 8.\\n\\n        8. Q - B 4 ch\\n\\nand the Rook is lost.\\n\\nNote, in these examples, that the checks at long range along the diagonals\\nhave often been the key to all the winning manoeuvres. Also that the Queen\\nand {67} King are often kept on different lines. The student should\\ncarefully go over these positions and consider all the possibilities not\\ngiven in the text.\\n\\nHe should once more go through everything already written before proceeding\\nfurther with the book.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{68}\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nPLANNING A WIN IN MIDDLE-GAME PLAY\\n\\nI shall now give a few winning positions taken from my own games. I have\\nselected those that I believe can be considered as _types_, i.e. positions\\nthat may easily occur again in a somewhat similar form. A knowledge of such\\npositions is of great help; in fact, one cannot know too many. It often may\\nhelp the player to find, with little effort, the right move, which he might\\nnot be able to find at all without such knowledge.\\n\\n17. ATTACKING WITHOUT THE AID OF KNIGHTS\\n\\n[Illustration] {69}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 43.--It is Black\\'s move, and as he is a Kt and P behind he must win\\nquickly, if at all. He plays:\\n\\n        1. ........               Q R - Kt 1 !\\n        2. R - B 2\\n\\nIf, Q x Q, R x P ch; K - R 1, B - Q 4 and mate follows in a few moves.\\n\\n        2. ........               R x P ch\\n        3. K - B 1                B - B 5 ch\\n        4. Kt x B                 R - Kt 8 mate\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 44.--Black\\'s last move was P - K 6, played with the object of\\nstopping what he thought was White\\'s threat, viz.: R - Q R 5, to which he\\nwould have answered Q - B 5 ch and drawn the game by perpetual check.\\nWhite, however, has a more forceful move, and he mates in three moves as\\nfollows: {70}\\n\\n        1. R x P ch               Q x R\\n        2. R - Q R 5              Black moves\\n        3. White mates\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 45.--White has a beautiful position, but still he had better gain\\nsome material, if he can, before Black consolidates his defensive position.\\nHe therefore plays:\\n\\n        1. R x Kt !               P x R\\n        2. B x P ch               K - K 2\\n\\nIf Kt x B; R x Kt and Black would be helpless.\\n\\n        3. Q - R 7 ch             K - K 1\\n        4. Q x Kt ch              K - Q 2\\n        5. Q - R 7 ch             Q - K 2\\n        6. B - B 8                Q x Q\\n        7. R x Q ch               K - K 1\\n        8. R x R                  Resigns\\n\\nIn these few examples the attacking has been done by Rooks and Bishops in\\ncombination with the Queen. {71} There have been no Knights to take part in\\nthe attack. We shall now give some examples in which the Knights play a\\nprominent part as an attacking force.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n18. ATTACKING WITH KNIGHTS AS A PROMINENT FORCE\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 46.--White is two Pawns behind. He must therefore press on his\\nattack. The game continues:\\n\\n        1.

Kt x Kt. Then would have followed: 2 Kt - B 6 ch, K - Kt 3;\\n3 Kt x B, P - B 3 (best); 4 P - K 5, K - B 2; 5 Kt x P, R - K 2;\\n6 Kt - K 4, and Black should lose.[4]\\n\\n{72}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 47.--The student should carefully examine the position, as the\\nsacrifice of the Bishop in similar situations is typical, and the chance\\nfor it is of frequent occurrence in actual play.

WINNING BY INDIRECT ATTACK\\n\\nWe have so far given positions where the attacks were of a violent nature\\nand directed against the King\\'s position. Very often, however, in the\\nmiddle-game attacks are made against a position or against pieces, or even\\nPawns.\\n\\n_The winning of a Pawn among good players of even strength often means the\\nwinning of the game._\\n\\nHence the study of such positions is of great importance. We give below two\\npositions in which the attack aims at the gain of a mere Pawn as a means of\\nultimately winning the game.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 48.--Black is a Pawn behind, and there is no violent direct attack\\nagainst White\\'s King. Black\\'s pieces, however, are very well placed and\\nfree to act, and by co-ordinating the action of all his pieces he is soon\\nable not only to regain the Pawn but to obtain the better game. The student\\nshould carefully {74} consider this position and the subsequent moves. It\\nis a very good example of proper co-ordination in the management of forces.\\nThe game continues:\\n\\n        1. ........               R - R 1\\n        2. P - Q R 4\\n\\nWhite\\'s best move was P - Q Kt 3, when would follow Kt x B; 3 Q x Kt,\\nR - R 6 and Black would ultimately win the Q R P, always keeping a slight\\nadvantage in position. The text move makes matters easier.\\n\\n        2. ........               Kt x B\\n        3. Q x Kt                 Q - B 5\\n        4. K R - Q 1              K R - Kt 1\\n\\nBlack could have regained the Pawn by playing B x Kt, but he sees that\\nthere is more to be had, and therefore increases the pressure against\\nWhite\\'s Queen side. He now threatens, among other things, R x Kt P.\\n\\n        5. Q - K 3                R - Kt 5\\n\\nThreatening to win the exchange by B - Q 5.\\n\\n        6. Q - Kt 5               B - Q 5 ch\\n        7. K - R 1                Q R - Kt 1\\n\\nThis threatens to win the Kt, and thus forces White to give up the\\nexchange.\\n\\n        8. R x B                  Q x R\\n        9. R - Q 1                Q - B 5\\n\\nNow Black will recover his Pawn. {75}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 49.--An examination of this position will show that Black\\'s main\\nweakness lies in the exposed position of his King, and in the fact that his\\nQ R has not yet come into the game. Indeed, if it were Black\\'s move, we\\nmight conclude that he would have the better game, on account of having\\nthree Pawns to two on the Queen\\'s side, and his Bishop commanding the long\\ndiagonal.\\n\\nIt is, however, White\\'s move, and he has two courses to choose from. The\\nobvious move, B - B 4, might be good enough, since after 1 B - B 4,\\nQ R - Q 1; 2 P - Q Kt 4 would make it difficult for Black. But there is\\nanother move which completely upsets Black\\'s position and wins a Pawn,\\nbesides obtaining the better position. That move is Kt - Q 4 ! The game\\ncontinues as follows:\\n\\n        1. Kt - Q 4 !             P x Kt\\n        2. R x B                  Kt - Kt 5\\n\\n{76}\\n\\nThere is nothing better, as White threatened B - B 4.\\n\\n        3. B - B 4 ch             K - R 1\\n        4. R - K 6                P - Q 6\\n        5. R x P\\n\\nAnd White, with the better position, is a Pawn ahead.\\n\\nThese positions have been given with the idea of acquainting the student\\nwith different types of combinations. I hope they will also help to develop\\nhis imagination, a very necessary quality in a good player. The student\\nshould note, in all these middle-game positions, that--\\n\\n_once the opportunity is offered, all the pieces are thrown into action \"en\\nmasse\" when necessary;_ and that _all the pieces smoothly co-ordinate their\\naction with machine-like precision._\\n\\nThat, at least, is what the ideal middle-game play should be, if it is not\\nso altogether in these examples.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{77}\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nGENERAL THEORY\\n\\nBefore we revert to the technique of the openings it will be advisable to\\ndwell a little on general theory, so that the openings in their relation to\\nthe rest of the game may be better understood.\\n\\n20. THE INITIATIVE\\n\\nAs the pieces are set on the board both sides have the same position and\\nthe same amount of material. White, however, has the move, and the move in\\nthis case means _the initiative_, and the initiative, other things being\\nequal, is an advantage. Now this advantage must be kept as long as\\npossible, and should only be given up if some other advantage, material or\\npositional, is obtained in its place. White, according to the principles\\nalready laid down, develops his pieces as fast as possible, but in so doing\\nhe also tries to hinder his opponent\\'s development, by applying pressure\\nwherever possible. He tries first of all to control the centre, and failing\\nthis to obtain some positional advantage that will make it possible for him\\nto keep on harassing the enemy. He only relinquishes the initiative when he\\ngets for it some material advantage under such favourable conditions as to\\nmake him feel {78} assured that he will, in turn, be able to withstand his\\nadversary\\'s thrust; and finally, through his superiority of material, once\\nmore resume the initiative, which alone can give him the victory. This last\\nassertion is self-evident, since, in order to win the game, the opposing\\nKing must be driven to a position where he is attacked without having any\\nway of escape. Once the pieces have been properly developed the resulting\\npositions may vary in character. It may be that a direct attack against the\\nKing is in order; or that it is a case of improving a position already\\nadvantageous; or, finally, that some material can be gained at the cost of\\nrelinquishing the initiative for a more or less prolonged period.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n21. DIRECT ATTACKS _EN MASSE_\\n\\nIn the first case the attack must be carried on with sufficient force to\\nguarantee its success. Under no consideration must a direct attack against\\nthe King be carried on _a outrance_ unless there is absolute certainty in\\none\\'s own mind that it will succeed, since failure in such cases means\\ndisaster.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 50.--A good example of a successful direct attack against the King\\nis shown in the following diagram:\\n\\nIn this position White could simply play B - B 2 and still have the better\\nposition, but instead he prefers an immediate attack on the King\\'s side,\\nwith {79} the certainty in his mind that the attack will lead to a win. The\\ngame continues thus:[6]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       12. B x P ch               K x B\\n       13. Kt - Kt 5 ch           K - Kt 3\\n       14. Q - Kt 4               P - B 4\\n\\nBest. P - K 4 would have been immediately fatal. Thus: 14...P - K 4;\\n15 Kt - K 6 ch, K - B 3; 16 P - B 4 ! P - K 5; 17 Q - Kt 5 ch, K x Kt;\\n18 Q - K 5 ch, K - Q 2; 19 K R - Q 1 ch, Kt - Q 6; 20 Kt x P, K - B 3 (if\\nK - K 1, Kt - Q 6 ch wins the Queen); 21 R x Kt, Q x R; 22 R - B 1 ch,\\nK - Kt 3 (if K - Q 2 mate in two); 23 Q - B 7 ch and mate in five moves.\\n\\n{80}\\n\\n       15. Q - Kt 3               K - R 3\\n       16. Q - R 4 ch             K - Kt 3\\n       17. Q - R 7 ch             K - B 3\\n\\nIf K x Kt; Q x Kt P ch and mate in a few moves.\\n\\n       18. P - K 4                Kt - Kt 3\\n       19. P x P                  P x P\\n       20. Q R - Q 1              Kt - Q 6\\n       21. Q - R 3                Kt (Q 6) - B 5\\n       22. Q - Kt 3               Q - B 2\\n       23. K R - K 1              Kt - K 7 ch\\n\\nThis blunder loses at once, but the game could not be saved in any case;\\ne.g. 23...B - K 3; 24 R x B ch, Kt x R; 25 Kt - Q 5 mate.\\n\\n       24. R x Kt                 Q x Q\\n       25. Kt - R 7 ch            K - B 2\\n       26. R P x Q                R - R 1\\n       27. Kt - Kt 5 ch           K - B 3\\n       28. P - B 4                Resigns\\n\\nEXAMPLE 51.--Another example of this kind:\\n\\n[Illustration] {81}\\n\\nIn the above position the simple move Kt x P would win, but White looks for\\ncomplications and their beauties. Such a course is highly risky until a\\nwide experience of actual master-play has developed a sufficient insight\\ninto all the possibilities of a position. This game, which won the\\nbrilliancy prize at St. Petersburg in 1914, continued as follows:--\\n\\n       21. B - R 4                Q - Q 2\\n       22. Kt x B                 Q x R\\n       23. Q - Q 8 ch             Q - K 1\\n\\nIf K - B 2; 24 Kt - Q 6 ch, King moves; 25 mate.\\n\\n       24. B - K 7 ch             K - B 2\\n       25. Kt - Q 6 ch            K - Kt 3\\n       26. Kt - R 4 ch            K - R 4\\n\\nIf 26...K - R 3; 27 Kt (Q 6) - B 5 ch, K - R 4; 28 Kt x P ch, K - R 3;\\n29 Kt (R 4) - B 5 ch, K - Kt 3; 30 Q - Q 6 ch and mate next move.\\n\\n       27. Kt x Q                 R x Q\\n       28. Kt x P ch              K - R 3\\n       29. Kt (Kt 7) - B 5 ch     K - R 4\\n       30. P - K R 3 !\\n\\nThe climax of the combination started with 21 B - R 4. White is still\\nthreatening mate, and the best way to avoid it is for Black to give back\\nall the material he has gained and to remain three Pawns behind.\\n\\nThe student should note that in the examples given the attack is carried\\nout with every available piece, {82} and that often, as in some of the\\nvariations pointed out, it is the coming into action of the last available\\npiece that finally overthrows the enemy. It demonstrates the principle\\nalready stated:\\n\\n_Direct and violent attacks against the King must be carried _en masse_,\\nwith full force, to ensure their success. The opposition must be overcome\\nat all cost; the attack cannot be broken off, since in all such cases that\\nmeans defeat._\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n22. THE FORCE OF THE THREATENED ATTACK\\n\\nFailing an opportunity, in the second case, for direct attack, one must\\nattempt to increase whatever weakness there may be in the opponent\\'s\\nposition; or, if there is none, one or more must be created. It is always\\nan advantage to threaten something, but such threats must be carried into\\neffect only if something is to be gained immediately. For, holding the\\nthreat in hand, forces the opponent to provide against its execution and to\\nkeep material in readiness to meet it. Thus he may more easily overlook, or\\nbe unable to parry, a thrust at another point. But once the threat is\\ncarried into effect, it exists no longer, and your opponent can devote his\\nattention to his own schemes. One of the best and most successful\\nmanoeuvres in this type of game is to make a demonstration on one side, so\\nas to draw the forces of your opponent to that side, then through the\\ngreater mobility of your pieces to shift your forces quickly {83} to the\\nother side and break through, before your opponent has had the time to\\nbring over the necessary forces for the defence.\\n\\nA good example of positional play is shown in the following game:\\n\\nEXAMPLE 52.--Played at the Havana International Masters Tournament, 1913.\\n(French Defence.) White: J. R. Capablanca. Black: R. Blanco.\\n\\n        1. P - K 4                P - K 3\\n        2. P - Q 4                P - Q 4\\n        3. Kt - Q B 3             P x P\\n        4.

Kt - K 5\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThis move was first shown to me by the talented Venezuelan amateur, M.\\nAyala. The object is to {84} prevent the development of Black\\'s Queen\\'s\\nBishop _via_ Q Kt 2, after P - Q Kt 3, which is Black\\'s usual development\\nin this variation. Generally it is bad to move the same piece twice in an\\nopening before the other pieces are out, and the violation of that\\nprinciple is the only objection that can be made to this move, which\\notherwise has everything to recommend it.\\n\\n        7. ........               B - Q 3\\n        8. Q - B 3\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nB - K Kt 5 might be better. The text move gives Black an opportunity of\\nwhich he does not avail himself\\n\\n        8. ........               P - B 3\\n\\nP - B 4 was the right move. It would have led to complications, in which\\nBlack might have held his own; at least, White\\'s play would be very\\ndifficult. The text move accomplishes nothing, and puts Black {85} in an\\naltogether defensive position. The veiled threat B x Kt; followed by\\nQ - R 4 ch; is easily met.\\n\\n        9. P - B 3                O - O\\n       10. B - K Kt 5             B - K 2\\n\\nThe fact that Black has now to move his Bishop back clearly demonstrates\\nthat Black\\'s plan of development is faulty. He has lost too much time, and\\nWhite brings his pieces into their most attacking position without\\nhindrance of any sort.\\n\\n       11. B - Q 3                Kt - K 1\\n\\nThe alternative was Kt - Q 4. Otherwise White would play Q - R 3, and Black\\nwould be forced to play P - K Kt 3 (not P - K R 3, because of the sacrifice\\nB x P), seriously weakening his King\\'s side.\\n\\n       12. Q - R 3                P - K B 4\\n\\nWhite has no longer an attack, but he has compelled Black to create a\\nmarked weakness. Now White\\'s whole plan will be to exploit this weakness\\n(the weak K P), and the student can now see how the principles expounded\\npreviously are applied in this game. Every move is directed to make the\\nweak King\\'s Pawn untenable, or to profit by the inactivity of the Black\\npieces defending the Pawn, in order to improve the position of White at\\nother points.\\n\\n       13. B x B                  Q x B\\n       14. O - O                  R - B 3\\n       15. K R - K 1              Kt - Q 3\\n       16. R - K 2                B - Q 2\\n\\n{86} At last the Bishop comes out, not as an active attacking piece, but\\nmerely to make way for the Rook.\\n\\n       17. Q R - K 1              R - K 1\\n       18. P - Q B 4              Kt - B 2\\n\\nA very clever move, tending to prevent P - B 5, and tempting White to play\\nKt x B, followed by B x P, which would be bad, as the following variation\\nshows: 19 Kt x B, Q x Kt; 20 B x P, Kt - Kt 4; 21 Q - Kt 4, R x B;\\n22 P - K R 4, P - K R 4; 23 Q x R, P x Q; 24 R x R ch, K - R 2; 25 P x Kt,\\nQ x P. But it always happens in such cases that, if one line of attack is\\nanticipated, there is another; and this is no exception to the rule, as\\nwill be seen.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       19. P - Q 5 !              Kt x Kt\\n\\nApparently the best way to meet the manifold threats of White. B P x P\\nwould make matters worse, as the White Bishop would finally bear on the\\nweak King\\'s Pawn _via_ Q B 4. {87}\\n\\n       20. R x Kt                 P - K Kt 3\\n       21.

Q - B 3                P - Kt 3\\n\\nQ - Q 3 was better. But Black wants to tempt White to play P x P, thinking\\nthat he will soon after regain his Pawn with a safe position. Such,\\nhowever, is not the case, as White quickly demonstrates. I must add that in\\nany case Black\\'s position is, in my opinion, untenable, since all his\\npieces are tied up for the defence of a Pawn, while White\\'s pieces are free\\nto act.\\n\\n       24. P x P                  B - B 1\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       25. B - K 2 !\\n\\nThe deciding and timely manoeuvre.

White will\\nnow try to place his Queen at K R 6, and then advance the K R P to R 5 in\\norder to break up the Black Pawns defending the King.\\n\\n       28.

CUTTING OFF PIECES FROM THE SCENE OF ACTION\\n\\nVery often in a game a master only plays to cut off, so to speak, one of\\nthe pieces from the scene of actual conflict. Often a Bishop or a Knight is\\ncompletely put out of action. In such cases we might say that from that\\nmoment the game is won, because for all practical purposes there will be\\none more piece on one side than on the other. A very good illustration is\\nfurnished by the following game. {95}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 54.--Played at the Hastings Victory Tournament, 1919. (Four\\nKnights.) White: W. Winter. Black: J. R. Capablanca.\\n\\n        1. P - K 4                P - K 4\\n        2. Kt - K B 3             Kt - Q B 3\\n        3. Kt - B 3               Kt - B 3\\n        4. B - Kt 5               B - Kt 5\\n        5. O - O                  O - O\\n        6. B x Kt\\n\\nNiemzowitch\\'s variation, which I have played successfully in many a game.\\nIt gives White a very solid game. Niemzowitch\\'s idea is that White will in\\ndue time be able to play P - K B 4, opening a line for his Rooks, which, in\\ncombination with the posting of a Knight at K B 5, should be sufficient to\\nwin. He thinks that should Black attempt to stop the Knight from going to\\nK B 5, he will have to weaken his game in some other way. Whether this is\\ntrue or not remains to be proved, but in my opinion the move is perfectly\\ngood. On the other hand, there is no question that Black can easily develop\\nhis pieces. But it must be considered that in this variation White does not\\nattempt to hinder Black\\'s development, he simply attempts to build up a\\nposition which he considers impregnable and from which he can start an\\nattack in due course.\\n\\n        6. ........               Q P x B\\n\\n{96} The alternative, Kt P x B; gives White the best of the game, without\\ndoubt.[8]\\n\\n        7. P - Q 3                B - Q 3\\n        8. B - Kt 5\\n\\nThis move is not at all in accordance with the nature of this variation.\\nThe general strategical plan for White is to play P - K R 3, to be followed\\nin time by the advance of the K Kt P to Kt 4, and the bringing of the Q Kt\\nto K B 5 via K 2 and K Kt 3 or Q 1 and K 3. Then, if possible, the K Kt is\\nlinked with the other Kt by placing it at either K R 4, K Kt 3, or K 3 as\\nthe occasion demands. The White King sometimes remains at Kt 1, and other\\ntimes it is placed at K Kt 2, but mostly at K R 1. Finally, in most cases\\ncomes P - K B 4, and then the real attack begins. Sometimes it is a direct\\nassault against the King,[9] and at other times it comes simply to\\nfinessing for positional advantage in the end-game, after most of the\\npieces have been exchanged.[10]\\n\\n        8. ........               P - K R 3\\n        9. B - R 4                P - B 4\\n\\n{97}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTo prevent P - Q 4 and to draw White into playing Kt - Q 5, which would\\nprove fatal. Black\\'s plan is to play P - K Kt 4, as soon as the\\ncircumstances permit, in order to free his Queen and Knight from the pin by\\nthe Bishop.\\n\\n       10. Kt - Q 5\\n\\nWhite falls into the trap. Only lack of experience can account for this\\nmove. White should have considered that a player of my experience and\\nstrength could never allow such a move if it were good.\\n\\n       10. ........               P - K Kt 4\\n\\n[Illustration] {98} After this move White\\'s game is lost. White cannot play\\nKt x Kt P, because Kt x Kt will win a piece. Therefore he must play\\nB - Kt 3, either before or after Kt x Kt, with disastrous results in either\\ncase, as will be seen.\\n\\n       11. Kt x Kt ch             Q x Kt\\n       12.

P x Q                  P - K B 3\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nA simple examination will show that White is minus a Bishop for all\\npractical purposes. He can only free it by sacrificing one Pawn, and\\npossibly not even then. At least it would lose time besides the Pawn. Black\\nnow devotes all his energy to the Queen\\'s side, and, having practically a\\nBishop more, the result cannot be in doubt. The rest of the game is given,\\nso that the student may see how simple it is to win such a game. {99}\\n\\n       16. K - Kt 2               P - Q R 4\\n       17.

A PLAYER\\'S MOTIVES CRITICISED IN A SPECIMEN GAME\\n\\nNow that a few of my games with my own notes have been given, I offer for\\nclose perusal and study a very fine game played by Sir George Thomas, one\\nof England\\'s foremost players, against Mr. F. F. L. Alexander, in the\\nchampionship of the City of London Chess Club in the winter of 1919-1920.\\nIt has the {100} interesting feature for the student that Sir George Thomas\\nkindly wrote the notes to the game for me at my request, and with the\\nunderstanding that I would make the comments on them that I considered\\nappropriate. Sir George Thomas\\' notes are in brackets and thus will be\\ndistinguished from my own comments.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 55.--Queen\\'s Gambit Declined. (_The notes within brackets by Sir\\nGeorge Thomas._) White: Mr. F. F. L. Alexander. Black: Sir George Thomas.\\n\\n        1. P - Q 4                P - Q 4\\n        2.

P - K 3                Q - R 4\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n(One of the objects of Black\\'s method of defence is to attack White\\'s Q Kt\\ndoubly by Kt - K 5, followed by P x P. But 7 Kt - Q 2 is probably a strong\\nway {101} of meeting this threat.) There are, besides, two good reasons for\\nthis method of defence; first, that it is not as much played as some of the\\nother defences and consequently not so well known, and second that it\\nleaves Black with two Bishops against B and Kt, which, in a general way,\\nconstitutes an advantage.\\n\\n        7. B x Kt                 Kt x B\\n        8. P - Q R 3              Kt - K 5\\n        9. Q - Kt 3               B - K 2\\n\\nThis is not the logical place for the B which should have been posted at\\nQ 3. In the opening, time is of great importance, and therefore the player\\nshould be extremely careful in his development and make sure that he posts\\nhis pieces in the right places.\\n\\n       10.

The same result could be\\naccomplished by playing B - Q 3. Incidentally it bears out my previous\\nstatement that the B should have been originally played to Q 3.\\n\\n       13. O - O\\n\\nThe alternative was P - K 4, followed by P - K 5, and then O - O. White\\nwould thereby assume the initiative but would weaken his Pawn position\\nconsiderably, and might be compelled to stake all on a {102} violent attack\\nagainst the King. This is a turning point in the game, and it is in such\\npositions that the temperament and style of the player decide the course of\\nthe game.\\n\\n       13. ........

I wanted him to advance this P as there is now a fine post\\nfor my B at Q B 4.) By this move White shows that he does not understand\\nthe true value of his position. His only advantage consisted in the\\nundeveloped condition of Black\\'s Q B. He should therefore have made a plan\\nto prevent the B from coming out, or if that were not possible, then he\\nshould try to force Black to weaken his Pawn position in order to come out\\nwith the B. There were three moves to consider: first, {103} P - Q R 4, in\\norder to maintain the White B in the dominating position that it now\\noccupies. This would have been met by Q - B 2; second, either of the Rooks\\nto Q 1 in order to threaten 16 P x P, B x P; 17 Kt x B, Q x Kt;\\n18 B x P ch. This would have been met by B - Kt 5; and third, P - K R 3 to\\nprevent B - Kt 5 and by playing either R to Q 1, followed up as previously\\nstated to force Black to play P - Q Kt 4, which would weaken his Queen\\'s\\nside Pawns. Thus by playing P - K R 3 White would have attained the desired\\nobject. The text move blocks the action of the White B and facilitates\\nBlack\\'s development. Hereafter White will act on the defensive, and the\\ninterest throughout the rest of the game will centre mainly on Black\\'s play\\nand the manner in which he carries out the attack.\\n\\n       15. ........               Q - B 2\\n       16. B - Q 3\\n\\n(This seems wrong, as it makes the development of Black\\'s Queen wing\\neasier.

Black\\'s play hereabout is weak; it lacks force, and\\nthere seems to be no well-defined plan of attack. It is true that these are\\nthe most difficult positions to handle in a game. In such cases a player\\nmust conceive a plan on a large scale, which promises chances of success,\\nand with it all, it must be a plan that can be carried out with the means\\nat his disposal. From the look of the position it seems that Black\\'s best\\nchance would be to mass his forces for an attack against White\\'s centre, to\\nbe followed by a direct attack against the King. He should, therefore, play\\nQ R - K 1, threatening P - K B 4. If White is able to defeat this plan, or\\nrather to prevent it, then, once he has fixed some of the White pieces on\\nthe King\\'s side, he should quickly shift his attack to the Queen\\'s side,\\nand open a line for his Rooks, which, once they enter in action, should\\nproduce an advantage on account of the great power of the two Bishops.\\n\\n       21.

If he retook with the Bishop\\'s Pawn I intended\\nto exchange Bishops and rely on the two Pawns to one on the Queen\\'s wing. I\\ndid not expect him to retake it with the King\\'s Pawn, which seemed to\\nexpose him to a violent King\\'s side attack.) Black\\'s judgment in this\\ninstance I believe to be faulty. Had White retaken with the B P, as he\\nexpected, he would have had the worst of the Pawn position, as White would\\nhave had a passed Pawn well supported on the Queen\\'s side. His only\\nadvantage would lie in his having a very well posted Bishop against a badly\\n{106} posted Knight, and on the fact that in such positions as the above,\\nthe Bishop is invariably stronger than the Knight. He could and should have\\nprevented all that, by playing B - B 1, as, had White then replied with\\nQ - Kt 3, he could then play P x P, and White would not have been able to\\nretake with the B P on account of B x P ch winning the exchange.\\n\\n       27.

The text move blocks the action of the powerful B at\\nQ B 4, and tends to make White\\'s position safer than it should have been.\\nThe move in itself is a very strong attacking move, but it is isolated, and\\nthere is no effective continuation.

Their importance will have\\nbecome evident to the student who has taken the trouble to study my game\\nwith Janowski (Example 53). After an uneventful opening--a Ruy Lopez--in\\none of its normal variations, my opponent suddenly made things interesting\\nby offering the exchange; an offer which, of course, I accepted. Then\\nfollowed a very hard, arduous struggle, in which I had to defend myself\\nagainst a very dangerous attack made possible by the excellent manoeuvring\\nof my adversary. Finally, there came the time when I could give back the\\nmaterial and change off most of the pieces, and come to an ending in which\\nI clearly had the advantage. But yet the ending itself was not as simple as\\nit at first appeared, and finally--perhaps through one weak move on my\\npart--it became a very difficult matter to find a win. Had I been a weak\\nend-game player the game would probably have ended in a draw, and all my\\nprevious efforts would have been in vain. Unfortunately, that is very often\\nthe case among the large majority of players; they are weak in the endings;\\na failing from which masters of the first rank are at times not free. {111}\\nIncidentally, I might call attention to the fact that all the world\\'s\\nchampions of the last sixty years have been exceedingly strong in the\\nendings: Morphy, Steinitz, and Dr. Lasker had no superiors in this\\ndepartment of the game while they held their titles.\\n\\n26. THE SUDDEN ATTACK FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE\\n\\nI have previously stated, when speaking about general theory, that at times\\nthe way to win consists in attacking first on one side, then, granted\\ngreater mobility of the pieces, to transfer the attack quickly from one\\nside to the other, breaking through before your opponent has been able to\\nbring up sufficient forces to withstand the attack. This principle of the\\nmiddle-game can sometimes be applied in the endings in somewhat similar\\nmanner.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 56.\\n\\n[Illustration] {112}\\n\\nIn the above position I, with the Black pieces, played:\\n\\n        1. ........               R - K 5 ch\\n        2. R - K 2                R - Q R 5\\n        3. R - R 2                P - K R 4\\n\\nThe idea, as will be seen very soon, is to play P - R 5 in order to fix\\nWhite\\'s King\\'s side Pawns with a view to the future. It is evident to Black\\nthat White wants to bring his King to Q Kt 3 to support his two weak\\nisolated Pawns, and thus to free his Rooks. Black, therefore, makes a plan\\nto shift the attack to the King\\'s side at the proper time, in order to\\nobtain some advantage from the greater mobility of his Rooks.\\n\\n        4. R - Q 1                R (Q 4) - Q R 4\\n\\nin order to force the Rook to Rook\\'s square, keeping both Rooks tied up.\\n\\n        5. R (Q 1) - R 1          P - R 5\\n        6. K - Q 2                K - Kt 2\\n        7. K - B 2                R - K Kt 4\\n\\nBlack begins to transfer his attack to the King\\'s side.\\n\\n        8. R - K Kt 1\\n\\nA serious mistake, which loses quickly. White should have played\\n8 K - Kt 3, when Black would have answered 8...R (R 5) - R 4; 9 P - B 3,\\nand Black would have obtained an opening at K Kt 6 for his King, which in\\nthe end might give him the victory.\\n\\n        8. ........               R - K B 5\\n\\n{113} Now the King cannot go to Kt 3, because of R - Kt 4 ch.\\n\\n        9. K - Q 3                R - B 6 ch\\n       10. K - K 2\\n\\nIf P x R, R x R; followed by R - K R 8 winning,\\n\\n       10. ........               R x R P\\n\\nand Black won after a few moves.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 57.--Another good example, in which is shown the advantage of the\\ngreater mobility of the pieces in an ending, is the following from a game\\nCapablanca-Kupchick played at the Havana Masters Tournament, 1913. The full\\nscore and notes of the game can be found in the book of the tournament.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite\\'s only advantage in the above position is that he possesses the open\\nfile and has the move, which will secure him the initiative. There is also\\nthe slight advantage of having his Pawns on the Queen\\'s side united, while\\nBlack has an isolated Q R P. The {114} proper course, as in the previous\\nending, is to bring the Rooks forward, so that at least one of them may be\\nable to shift from one side of the board to the other, and thus keep\\nBlack\\'s Rooks from moving freely. What this means in general theory has\\nbeen stated already; it really means: _keep harassing the enemy; force him\\nto use his big pieces to defend Pawns. If he has a weak point, try to make\\nit weaker, or create another weakness somewhere else and his position will\\ncollapse sooner or later. If he has a weakness, and he can get rid of it,\\nmake sure that you create another weakness somewhere else_.\\n\\nFrom the position in question the game continued thus:\\n\\n        1. R - K 4                K R - K 1\\n\\nwith the object of repeating White\\'s manoeuvre, and also not to allow White\\nthe control of the open file.\\n\\n        2. Q R - K 1              R - K 3\\n        3. Q R - K 3              R (B 1) - K 1\\n        4. K - B 1                K - B 1\\n\\nBlack wants to bring his King to the centre of the board in order to be\\nnearer to whatever point White decides to attack. The move is justified at\\nleast on the general rule that in such endings the King should be in the\\nmiddle of the board. He does nothing after all but follow White\\'s\\nfootsteps. Besides, it is hard to point out anything better. If\\n4...P - Q 4; 5 R - Kt 4 ch, followed by K - K 2, would leave Black in {115}\\na very disagreeable position. If 4...P - K B 4; 5 R - Q 4! R x R? 6 P x R,\\nR x P; 7 K - B 2, R - K 2; 8 R - Q R 4, winning the Q R P, which would\\npractically leave White with a passed Pawn ahead on the Queen\\'s side, as\\nthe three Pawns of Black on the King\\'s side would be held by the two of\\nWhite.\\n\\n        5. K - K 2                K - K 2\\n        6. R - Q R 4              R - Q R 1\\n\\nThe student should note that through the same manoeuvre Black is forced\\ninto a position similar to the one shown in the previous ending.\\n\\n        7. R - R 5!\\n\\nThis move has a manifold object. It practically fixes all of Black\\'s Pawns\\nexcept the Q P, which is the only one that can advance two squares. It\\nspecially prevents the advance of Black\\'s K B Pawns, and at the same time\\nthreatens the advance of White\\'s K B Pawns to B 4 and B 5. By this threat\\nit practically forces Black to play P - Q 4, which is all White desires,\\nfor reasons that will soon become evident.\\n\\n        7. ........               P - Q 4\\n        8. P - Q B 4!             K - Q 3\\n\\nEvidently forced, as the only other move to save a Pawn would have been\\nP x P, which would have left all Black\\'s Pawns isolated and weak. If\\n8...P - Q 5; 9 R - K 4, K - Q 3; 10 P - Q Kt 4! R - K 4; 11 R - R 6, and\\nBlack\\'s game is hopeless.\\n\\n        9. P - B 5 ch             K - Q 2\\n       10. P - Q 4                P - B 4\\n\\n{116} Apparently very strong, since it forces the exchange of Rooks because\\nof the threat R - R 3; but in reality it leads to nothing. The best chance\\nwas to play R - K K 1.\\n\\n       11. R x R                  P x R\\n       12. P - B 4\\n\\nUp to now White had played with finesse, but this last move is weak.\\nR - R 6 was the proper way to continue, so as to force Black to give up his\\nQ R P or Q B P.\\n\\n       12. ........               K - B 1\\n       13. K - Q 2\\n\\nAgain a bad move. 13 R - R 3 was the proper continuation, and if then\\n13...R - Kt 1; 14 P - Kt 3, K - Kt 2; 15 P - Kt 4, K - R 1; 16 R - Q Kt 3,\\nwith excellent winning chances; in fact, I believe, a won game.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       13. ........               K - Kt 2\\n\\nBlack misses his only chance. R - Kt 1 would have drawn. {117}\\n\\n       14. R - R 3                R - K Kt 1\\n       15. R - R 3                R - Kt 2\\n       16.

K - Q 3                K - Kt 2\\n\\nHe goes back with the King to support his K P, and thus be able to utilise\\nhis Rook. It is, however, useless, and only White\\'s weak play later on\\ngives him further chances of a draw.\\n\\n       19. P - K R 4              K - B 1\\n       20.

P - Kt 4               R - B 3\\n\\nThe only other move was K - R 2; when White could play R - Kt 7, or even\\nP - Kt 5. {118}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       28. P - Kt 5\\n\\nA weak move, which gives Black a fighting chance. In this ending, as is\\noften the case with most players, White plays the best moves whenever the\\nsituation is difficult and requires careful handling, but once his position\\nseems to be overwhelming he relaxes his efforts and the result is nothing\\nto be proud of. The right move was 28 R - Kt 7.\\n\\n       28. ........               R P x P\\n       29. P x P                  R - B 1 !\\n       30. R - Kt 7               R - R 1 ch\\n       31.

R - K 7                R x P\\n\\nR - Kt 7 ch; followed by R - K R 7, offered better chances.\\n\\n       38. P - R 6!               R x P ch\\n       39. K - Kt 5               R - Q 8\\n       40.

THE DANGER OF A SAFE POSITION\\n\\nEXAMPLE 58.--A good proof of the previous statement is shown in the\\nfollowing ending between Marshall and Kupchick in one of their two games in\\nthe same Tournament (Havana, 1913).\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is evident that Marshall (White) is under great difficulties in the\\nabove position. Not only is he bound to lose a Pawn, but his position is\\nrather poor. The best he could hope for was a draw unless something\\naltogether unexpected happened, as it did. No reason can be given for\\nBlack\\'s loss of the game except that he felt so certain of having the best\\nof it with a Pawn more and what he considered a safe position, that he\\nbecame exceedingly careless and did not consider the danger that actually\\nexisted. Let us see how it happened.\\n\\n        1. P - Kt 4               R x R P\\n\\n{121} The mistakes begin. This is the first. Black sees that he can take a\\nPawn without any danger, and does not stop to think whether there is\\nanything better. R - B 7 ch was the right move. If then K - Kt 3, R x P. If\\ninstead White played K - K 4, then R - K 4 ch followed by R x R P.\\n\\n        2. R - Q 1                R - R 5 ch\\n\\nMistake number two, and this time such a serious one as to almost lose the\\ngame. The proper move was to play P - B 4 in order to break up White\\'s\\nPawns and at the same time make room for the Black King, which is actually\\nin danger, as will soon be seen.\\n\\n        3. R - Q 4                R (R5) - R 4\\n\\nMistake number three and this time fatal. His best move was R (Kt 4) - R 4.\\nAfter the text move there is no defence. Black\\'s game is lost. This shows\\nthat even an apparently simple ending has to be played with care. From a\\npractically won position Black finds himself with a lost game, and it has\\nonly taken three moves.\\n\\n        4. R (Q 4) - Q 8          R - Kt 2\\n\\nIf 4...P - B 4; 5 R - R 8 ch, K - Kt 3; 6 R (B 8) - Kt 8 ch, K - B 3;\\n7 R x P ch, R - Kt 3; 8 P - Kt 5 ch, K - K 2; 9 R (R 6) x R, P x R;\\n10 R - Kt 7 ch, K - K 1; 11 R x Kt P, and wins easily.\\n\\n        5. P - R 4                P - R 4\\n        6. R - R 8 ch             Resigns.\\n\\nThe reason is evident. If 6...K - Kt 3; 7 P x P ch, {122} R x P; 8 R x R,\\nK x R; 9 R - R 8 ch, K - Kt 3; 10 P - R 5 mate.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n28. ENDINGS WITH ONE ROOK AND PAWNS\\n\\nThe reader has probably realised by this time that endings of two Rooks and\\nPawns are very difficult, and that the same holds true for endings of one\\nRook and Pawns. Endings of two Rooks and Pawns are not very common in\\nactual play; but endings of one Rook and Pawns are about the most common\\nsort of endings arising on the chess board. Yet though they do occur so\\noften, few have mastered them thoroughly. They are often of a very\\ndifficult nature, and sometimes while apparently very simple they are in\\nreality extremely intricate. Here is an example from a game between\\nMarshall and Rosenthal in the Manhattan Chess Club Championship Tournament\\nof 1909-1910.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 59.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n{123} In this position Marshall had a simple win by R - B 7 ch, but played\\nP - B 6, and thereby gave Black a chance to draw. Luckily for him Black did\\nnot see the drawing move, played poorly, and lost. Had Black been up to the\\nsituation he would have drawn by playing R - Q 3.\\n\\n        1. P - B 6                R - Q 3 !\\n\\nNow White has two continuations, either (_a_) P - B 7, or (_b_) R - B 7 ch.\\nWe have therefore:\\n\\n  (a)   2. P - B 7                R - Q 1 !\\n        3. R - R 5 ch             K - B 5\\n\\nand White will finally have to sacrifice the Rook for Black\\'s Pawn. Or--\\n\\n  (b)   2. R - B 7 ch             K - Q 5 !\\n        3. P - B 7                R - Kt 3 ch !\\n\\na very important move, as against R - K B 3, R - K 7 wins.\\n\\n        4. K - B 1                R - K B 3\\n        5. R - Kt 7               K - B 6\\n\\nand White will finally have to sacrifice the Rook for the Pawn, or draw by\\nperpetual check.\\n\\nIf there were nothing more in the ending it would not be of any great\\nvalue, but there are other very interesting features. Now suppose that\\nafter 1 P - B 6, R - Q 3; 2 P - B 7, Black did not realise that R - Q 1 was\\nthe only move to draw. {124} We would then have the following position:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNow there would be two other moves to try: either (_a_) R - Kt 3 ch, or\\n(_b_) R - K B 3. Let us examine them.\\n\\n  (a)   1. ........               R - Kt 3 ch\\n        2. K - B 3                R - B 3 ch\\n        3. K - K 3                R - K 3 ch\\n\\nIf P - Kt 6; R - R 5 ch wins, because if the King goes back, then R - R 6,\\nand if the King goes up, then R - R 4 ch, followed by R - K B 4 wins.\\n\\n        4. K - Q 3                R - K B 3\\n\\nIf R - Q 3 ch; K - K 4 wins.\\n\\n        5. R - R 5 ch             K moves\\n        6. R - R 6 wins\\n\\n\\n\\n  (b)   1. ........               R - B 3\\n        2. R - Kt 7 !             K - B 5\\n\\nIf P - Kt 6; R - Kt 3, and White will either capture the Pawn or go to\\nK B 3, and come out with a winning ending. {125}\\n\\n        3. P - R 4                P - Kt 6\\n        4. R - Kt 4 ch            K moves\\n        5. R - Kt 3\\n\\nand White will either capture the Pawn or play R - K B 3, according to the\\ncircumstances, and come out with a winning ending.\\n\\nNow, going back to the position shown on page 122, suppose that after\\n1 P - B 6, R - Q 3; 2 R - B 7 ch, Black did not realise that K - Q 5 was\\nthe only move to draw, and consequently played K - Kt 3 instead, we would\\nthen have the following position:\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNow the best continuation would be:\\n\\n        1. P - B 7                R - Kt 3 ch (best)\\n        2. K - B 1                R - K B 3\\n        3. R - K 7 !

K - K 3\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThis position we have arrived at is won by White, because there are two\\nfiles between the opposing King and the Pawn from which the King is cut off\\nby the Rook, and besides, the Pawn can advance to the fourth rank before\\nthe opponent\\'s Rook can begin to check on the file. This last condition is\\nvery important, because if, instead of the position on the diagram, the\\nBlack Rook were at K R 1, and Black had the move, he could draw by\\npreventing the {127} advance of the Pawn, either through constant checks or\\nby playing R - K B 1 at the proper time.\\n\\nNow that we have explained the reasons why this position is won, we leave\\nit to the student to work out the correct solution.\\n\\nThe fact that out of one apparently simple ending we have been able to work\\nout several most unusual and difficult endings should be sufficient to\\nimpress upon the student\\'s mind the necessity of becoming well acquainted\\nwith all kinds of endings, and especially with endings of Rook and Pawns.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n29. A DIFFICULT ENDING: TWO ROOKS AND PAWNS\\n\\nFollowing our idea that the best way to learn endings as well as openings\\nis to study the games of the masters, we give two more endings of two Rooks\\nand Pawns. These endings, as already stated, are not very common, and the\\nauthor is fortunate in having himself played more of these endings than is\\ngenerally the case. By carefully comparing and studying the endings already\\ngiven (Examples 56 and 57) with the following, the student no doubt can\\nobtain an idea of the proper method to be followed in such cases. The way\\nof procedure is somewhat similar in all of them.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 60.--From a game, Capablanca-Kreymborg, in the New York State\\nChampionship Tournament of 1910. {128}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt is Black\\'s move, and no doubt thinking that drawing such a position\\n(that was all Black played for) would be easy, he contented himself with a\\nwaiting policy. Such conduct must always be criticised. It often leads to\\ndisaster. _The best way to defend such positions is to assume the\\ninitiative and keep the opponent on the defensive._\\n\\n        1. ........               Q R - K 1\\n\\nThe first move is already wrong. There is nothing to gain by this move.\\nBlack should play P - Q R 4; to be followed by P - Q R 5; unless White\\nplays P - Q Kt 3. That would _fix_ the Queen\\'s side. After that he could\\ndecide what demonstration he could make with his Rooks to keep the\\nopponent\\'s Rooks at bay.\\n\\n        2. R - Q 4\\n\\nThis move not only prevents P - B 5 which Black intended, but threatens\\nP - Kt 3, followed, after {129} P x P ch, by the attack with one or both\\nRooks against Black\\'s Q R P.\\n\\n        2. ........               R - B 3\\n\\nprobably with the idea of a demonstration on the King\\'s side by R - Kt 3\\nand Kt 7.\\n\\n        3. P - Kt 3               P x P ch\\n        4. P x P                  K - B 2\\n        5. K - Q 3\\n\\nR - Q R 1 should have been played now, in order to force Black to defend\\nwith R - K 2. White, however, does not want to disclose his plan at once,\\nand thus awaken Black to the danger of his position, hence this move, which\\nseems to aim at the disruption of Black\\'s Queen\\'s side Pawns.\\n\\n        5. ........               R - K 2\\n        6. R - Q R 1              K - K 3\\n\\nThis is a mistake. Black is unaware of the danger of his position. He\\nshould have played P - Kt 4; threatening R - R 3, and, by making this\\ndemonstration against White\\'s K R P, stop the attack against his Queen\\'s\\nside Pawns, which will now develop.\\n\\n        7. R - R 6                R - Q B 2\\n\\nHe could not play K - Q 3, because P - Q B 4 would win at least a Pawn.\\nThis in itself condemns his last move K - K 3, which has done nothing but\\nmake his situation practically hopeless.\\n\\n        8. R (Q 4) - Q R 4        P - K Kt 4\\n\\nNow forced, but it is a little too late. He could not play 8...K R - B 2,\\nbecause P - K B 4 would have {130} left his game completely paralysed.\\nBlack now finally awakens to the danger, and tries to save the day by the\\ncounter-demonstration on the King\\'s side, which he should have started\\nbefore. Of course, White cannot play R x R P, because of R x R, followed by\\nR - R 3, recovering the Pawn with advantage.\\n\\n        9. P - K R 4 !            P - Kt 5\\n\\nBlack is now in a very disagreeable position. If he played 9...P x P;\\n10 R x P would leave him in a very awkward situation, as he could not go\\nback with the King, nor could he do much with either Rook. He practically\\nwould have to play 10...P - K R 3, when White would answer 11 P - Kt 4,\\nthreatening to win a Pawn by P - Kt 5, or, if that were not enough, he\\nmight play K - Q 4, to be followed finally by the entry of the King at B 5\\nor K 5.\\n\\n       10. K - K 2\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n{131} /*    10. ........ P x P ch */\\n\\nAgain he cannot play P - K R 4, because P - K B 4 would leave him\\nparalysed. The advance of his K R P would make White\\'s K R P safe, and\\nconsequently his K R would have to retire to K B 2 to defend the Q R P.\\nThat would make it impossible for his King to go to Q 2, because of the\\nQ R P, nor could he advance a single one of his Pawns. On the other hand,\\nWhite would play P - Kt 4, threatening to win a Pawn by P - Kt 5, or he\\nmight first play K - Q 4, and then at the proper time P - Kt 5, if there\\nwas nothing better. Black meanwhile could really do nothing but mark time\\nwith one of his Rooks. Compare this bottling-up system with the ending in\\nExample 57, and it will be seen that it is very similar.\\n\\n       11. K x P                  R (B 3) - B 2\\n       12. K - K 2\\n\\nProbably wrong. P - Kt 4 at once was the right move. The text move gives\\nBlack good chances of drawing.\\n\\n       12. ........               K - Q 3\\n       13. P - Kt 4               R - Q Kt 2\\n\\nThis could never have happened had White played 12 P - Kt 4, as he could\\nhave followed it up by P - Kt 5 after Black\\'s K - Q 3.\\n\\n       14. P - R 5\\n\\nNot good. P - K B 4 offered the best chances of {132} winning by force. If\\nthen 14...R - Kt 2; 15 P - R 5, R - Kt 7 ch; 16 K - Q 3, R - K R 7;\\n17 R x P, R x R; 18 R x R, R x P; 19 R - R 6, with winning chances.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       14. ........

It is on this fact that White builds\\nhis plans. He will stop Black\\'s Queen\\'s side Pawns from advancing, and will\\nthen bring his own King to K 3. Then in due time he will play P - Q 4, and\\nfinally P - K 5, or P - K Kt 5, thus forcing an exchange of Pawns and\\nobtaining in that way a clear passed Pawn on the King\\'s file. It will be\\nseen that this plan was carried out during the course of the game, and that\\nWhite obtained his winning advantage in that way. The play was based\\nthroughout on the chance of obtaining a passed Pawn on the King\\'s file,\\nwith which White expected to win.\\n\\n        1.

It means in general terms--\\n\\n_Keep freedom of manoeuvre while hampering your opponent._\\n\\nThere is one more thing of great importance, and that is that the winning\\nside has always had a general strategical plan capable of being carried out\\nwith the means at his disposal, while often the losing side had no plan at\\nall, but simply moved according to the needs of the moment.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n30. ROOK, BISHOP AND PAWNS _v._ ROOK, KNIGHT AND PAWNS\\n\\nWe shall now examine an ending of Rook, Bishop and Pawns against Rook,\\nKnight and Pawns, where it will be seen that the Rook at times is used in\\nthe same way as in the endings already given.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 62.--From the first game of the Lasker-Marshall Championship Match\\nin 1907. {139}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIn this position it is Black\\'s move. To a beginner the position may look\\nlike a draw, but the advanced player will realise immediately that there\\nare great possibilities for Black to win, not only because he has the\\ninitiative, but because of White\\'s undeveloped Queen\\'s side and the fact\\nthat a Bishop in such a position is better than a Knight (see Section 14).\\nIt will take some time for White to bring his Rook and Knight into the\\nfray, and Black can utilise it to obtain an advantage. There are two\\ncourses open to him. The most evident, and the one that most players would\\ntake, is to advance the Pawn to Q B 4 and Q B 5 immediately in conjunction\\nwith the Bishop check at R 3 and any other move that might be necessary\\nwith the Black Rook. The other, and more subtle, course was taken by Black.\\nIt consists in utilising his Rook in the same way as shown in the previous\\nendings, forcing White to defend something all the time, restricting the\\naction of White\\'s Knight and {140} White\\'s Rook, while at the same time\\nkeeping freedom of action for his own Rook and Bishop.\\n\\n        1. ........

P - Kt 3               R - Kt 4\\n\\nbringing the Rook to attack the King\\'s side Pawns so as to force the King\\nto that side to defend them, and thus indirectly making more secure the\\nposition of Black\\'s Queen\\'s side Pawns.\\n\\n        3. P - B 4                R - K R 4\\n        4. K - Kt 1               P - B 4\\n\\nNote that the White Knight\\'s sphere of action is very limited, and that\\nafter Kt - Q 2 White\\'s own Pawns are in his way.\\n\\n        5. Kt - Q 2               K - B 2\\n        6. R - B 1 ch\\n\\nThis check accomplishes nothing. It merely drives Black\\'s King where it\\nwants to go. Consequently it is a very bad move.

SOME SALIENT POINTS ABOUT PAWNS\\n\\nBefore going back to the discussion of openings and middle-game positions,\\nit might be well to bear in mind a few facts concerning Pawn positions\\nwhich will no doubt help to understand certain moves, and sometimes even\\nthe object of certain variations in the openings, and of some manoeuvres in\\nthe middle-games.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 63.--In the position of the diagram we have an exceedingly bad Pawn\\nformation on Black\\'s side. Black\\'s Q B P is altogether backward, and White\\ncould by means of the open file concentrate {144} his forces against that\\nweak point. There is also the square at White\\'s Q B 5, which is controlled\\nby White, and from where a White piece once established could not be\\ndislodged. In order to get rid of it, Black would have to exchange it,\\nwhich is not always an easy matter, and often when possible not at all\\nconvenient. The same holds true with regard to Black\\'s K P, K B P and\\nK Kt P, which create what is called a \"hole\" at Black\\'s K B 3. Such Pawn\\nformations invariably lead to disaster, and consequently must be avoided.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEXAMPLE 64.--In this position we might say that the White centre Pawns have\\nthe attacking position, while the Black centre Pawns have the defensive\\nposition. Such a formation of Pawn occurs in the French Defence. In such\\npositions White most often attempts, by means of P - K B 4 and K B 5, to\\nobtain a crushing attack against Black\\'s King, which is generally Castled\\non the King\\'s side. To prevent that, {145} and also to assume the\\ninitiative or obtain material advantage, Black makes a\\ncounter-demonstration by P - Q B 4, followed by P x P (when White defends\\nthe Pawn by P - Q B 3), and the concentrating of Black\\'s pieces against the\\nWhite Pawn at Q 4. This in substance might be said to be a determined\\nattack against White\\'s centre in order to paralyse the direct attack of\\nWhite against Black\\'s King. It must be remembered that at the beginning of\\nthe book it was stated that _control of the centre was an essential\\ncondition to a successful attack against the King_.\\n\\nIn an abstract way we may say that two or more Pawns are strongest when\\nthey are in the same rank next to one another. Thus the centre Pawns are\\nstrongest in themselves, so to speak, when placed at K 4 and Q 4\\nrespectively, hence the question of advancing either the one or the other\\nto the fifth rank is one that must be most carefully considered. The\\nadvance of either Pawn often determines the course the game will follow.\\n\\nAnother thing to be considered is the matter of one or more passed Pawns\\nwhen they are isolated either singly or in pairs. We might say that a\\npassed Pawn is either very weak or very strong, and that its weakness or\\nstrength, whichever happens to be in the case to be considered, increases\\nas it advances, and is at the same time in direct relation to the number of\\npieces on the board. In this last respect it might be generally said that\\n_a passed Pawn increases in strength as the number of pieces on the board\\ndiminishes_. {146}\\n\\nHaving all this clear in mind we will now revert to the openings and\\nmiddle-game. We will analyse games carefully from beginning to end\\naccording to general principles. I shall, whenever possible, use my own\\ngames, not because they will better illustrate the point, but because,\\nknowing them thoroughly, I shall be able to explain them more\\nauthoritatively than the games of others.\\n\\n32. SOME POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS FROM A RUY LOPEZ\\n\\nThat some of the variations in the openings and the manoeuvres in the\\nmiddle-game are often based on some of the elementary principles just\\nexpounded can be easily seen in the following case:\\n\\nEXAMPLE 65.\\n\\n        1. P - K 4                P - K 4\\n        2. Kt - K B 3             Kt - Q B 3\\n        3. B - Kt 5               P - Q R 3\\n        4. B - R 4                Kt - B 3\\n        5. O - O                  Kt x P\\n        6. P - Q 4                P - Q Kt 4\\n        7. B - Kt 3               P - Q 4\\n        8. P x P                  B - K 3\\n        9. P - B 3                B - K 2\\n       10. R - K 1                Kt - B 4\\n       11. B - B 2                B - Kt 5\\n       12. Q Kt - Q 2             O - O\\n       13. Kt - Kt 3              Kt - K 3\\n\\n{147}\\n\\nSo far a very well-known variation of the Ruy Lopez. In fact, they are the\\nmoves of the Janowski-Lasker game in Paris, 1912.\\n\\n       14. Q - Q 3                P - Kt 3\\n\\nLet us suppose the game went on, and that in some way White, by playing one\\nof the Knights to Q 4 at the proper time, forced the exchange of both\\nKnights, and then afterwards both the Bishops were exchanged, and we\\narrived at some such position as shown in the following diagram. (I\\nobtained such a position in a very similar way once at Lodz in Poland. I\\nwas playing the White pieces against a consulting team headed by Salwe.)\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNow we would have here the case of the backward Q B P, which will in no way\\nbe able to advance to Q B 4. Such a position may be said to be\\ntheoretically lost, and in practice a first-class master will invariably\\nwin it from Black. (If I may be excused the reference, I will say that I\\nwon the game above referred to.)\\n\\nAfter a few moves the position may be easily thus: {148}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe Black pieces can be said to be _fixed_. If White plays Q - Q B 3, Black\\nmust answer Q - Q 2, otherwise he will lose a Pawn, and if White returns\\nwith the Queen to Q R 3 Black will have again to return to Q Kt 2 with the\\nQueen or lose a Pawn. Thus Black can only move according to White\\'s lead,\\nand under such conditions White can easily advance with his Pawns to K B 4\\nand K Kt 4, until Black will be forced to stop P - B 5 by playing\\nP - K B 4, and we might finally have some such position as this:\\n\\nEXAMPLE 66.\\n\\n[Illustration] {149}\\n\\nIn this situation the game might go on as follows:\\n\\n        1. P x P, P x P; 2. Q - K B 3, Q - Q 2\\n\\nWhite threatened to win a Pawn by Q x P, and Black could not play\\n2...R - K B 1, because 3 R x B P would also win a Pawn at least.\\n\\n        3. R (B 5) - B 2,         R - Kt 3;\\n        4. R - Kt 2,              K - R 1;\\n        5. R (B 1) - K Kt 1,      R (B 1) - K Kt 1;\\n        6. Q - R 5,               R x R;\\n        7. R x R,                 R x R;\\n        8. K x R,                 Q - Kt 2 ch;\\n        9. K - R 2,               Q - Kt 3;\\n       10. Q x Q,                 P x Q;\\n       11. P - Kt 4, and White wins.\\n\\nNow suppose that in the position in the preceding diagram it were Black\\'s\\nmove, and he played R - K B 1. White would then simply defend his K B P by\\nsome move like Q - K B 3, threatening R x Q B P, and then he would bring\\nhis King up to Kt 3, and when the time came, break through, as in the\\nprevious case. White might even be able to obtain the following position:\\n\\n[Illustration] {150}\\n\\nBlack would now be forced to play R - B 1, and White could then play\\nQ - B 2, and follow it up with K B 3, and thus force Black to play P x P,\\nwhich would give White a greater advantage.\\n\\nA careful examination of all these positions will reveal that, besides the\\nadvantage of freedom of manoeuvre on White\\'s part, the power of the Pawn at\\nK 5 is enormous, and that it is the commanding position of this Pawn, and\\nthe fact that it is free to advance, once all the pieces are exchanged,\\nthat constitute the pivot of all White\\'s manoeuvres.\\n\\nI have purposely given positions without the moves which lead to them so\\nthat the student may become accustomed to build up in his own mind possible\\npositions that may arise (out of any given situation). Thus he will learn\\nto make strategical plans and be on his way to the master class. The\\nstudent can derive enormous benefit by further practice of this kind.\\n\\n33. THE INFLUENCE OF A \"HOLE\"\\n\\nThe influence of a so-called \"hole\" in a game has already been illustrated\\nin my game against Blanco (page 81), where has been shown the influence\\nexercised by the different pieces posted in the hole created at White\\'s\\nK 5. {151}\\n\\nEXAMPLE 67.--In order to further illustrate this point, I now give a game\\nplayed in the Havana International Masters Tournament of 1913. (Queen\\'s\\nGambit Declined.) White: D. Janowski. Black: A. Kupchick.\\n\\n        1. P - Q 4                P - Q 4\\n        2. P - Q B 4              P - K 3\\n        3. Kt - Q B 3             Kt - K B 3\\n        4. B - Kt 5               B - K 2\\n        5. P - K 3                Q Kt - Q 2\\n        6. B - Q 3                P x P\\n        7. B x P                  Kt - Kt 3\\n\\nOf course the idea is to post a Knight at Q 4, but as it is the other\\nKnight which will be posted there this manoeuvre does not seem logical. The\\nKnight at Kt 3 does nothing except to prevent the development of his own\\nQ B. The normal course O - O, followed by P - Q B 4, is more reasonable.\\nFor a beautiful illustration of how to play White in that variation, see\\nthe Janowski-Rubinstein game of the St. Petersburg Tournament of 1914.\\n\\n        8. B - Q 3\\n\\nB - Kt 3 has some points in its favour in this position, the most important\\nbeing the possibility of advancing the King\\'s Pawn immediately after\\n8. ... K Kt - Q 4; 9 B x B, Q x B.\\n\\n        8. ........               K Kt - Q 4\\n        9. B x B                  Q x B\\n       10. Kt - B 3\\n\\n{152} Had White\\'s Bishop been at Q Kt 3 he could now play P - K 4 as\\nindicated in the previous note, a move which he cannot make in the present\\nposition, because of Kt - K B 5 threatening, not only the K Kt P, but also\\nKt x B ch. As White\\'s King\\'s Bishop should never be exchanged in this\\nopening without a very good reason White therefore cannot play P - K 4.\\n\\n       10. ........               O - O\\n       11. O - O                  B - Q 2\\n       12. R - B 1\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhite is perfectly developed, and now threatens to win a Pawn as follows:\\nKt x Kt, Kt x Kt; P - K 4, followed by R x P.\\n\\n       12. ........               P - Q B 3\\n\\nThe fact that Black is practically forced to make this move in order to\\navoid the loss of a Pawn is sufficient reason in itself to condemn the\\nwhole system of development on Black\\'s part. In effect, he plays B - Q 2\\nand now he has to shut off the action of his {153} own Bishop, which\\nthereby becomes little more than a Pawn for a while. In fact, it is hard to\\nsee how this Bishop will ever be able to attack anything. Besides, it can\\nbe easily seen that White will soon post his two Knights at K 5 and Q B 5\\nrespectively, and that Black will not be able to dislodge them without\\nseriously weakening his game, if he can do it at all. From all these\\nreasons it can be gathered that it would probably have been better for\\nBlack to play Kt x Kt and thus get rid of one of the two White Knights\\nbefore assuming such a defensive position. In such cases, the less the\\nnumber of pieces on the board, the better chances there are to escape.\\n\\n       13. Kt - K 4               P - K B 4\\n\\nThis practically amounts to committing suicide, since it creates a hole at\\nK 5 for White\\'s Knight, from where it will be practically impossible to\\ndislodge him. If Black intended to make such a move he should have done it\\nbefore, when at least there would have been an object in preventing the\\nWhite Knight from reaching B 5.\\n\\n       14. Kt - B 5               B - K 1\\n       15. Kt - K 5\\n\\nThe position of White\\'s Knights, especially the one at K 5, might be said\\nto be ideal, and a single glance shows how they dominate the position. The\\nquestion henceforth will be how is White going to derive the full benefit\\nfrom such an advantageous situation, This we shall soon see. {154}\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       15. ........               R - Kt 1\\n\\nThere is no object in this move, unless it is to be followed by Kt - Q 2.\\nAs that is not the case, he might have gone with the Rook to B 1, as he\\ndoes later.\\n\\n       16. R - K 1                R - B 3\\n       17. Q - B 3                R - R 3\\n       18. Q - Kt 3               R - B 1\\n\\nWhite threatened to win the exchange by playing either Kt - B 7 or\\nKt - Kt 4.\\n\\n       19. P - B 3                R - B 2\\n       20. P - Q R 3              K - R 1\\n       21. P - R 3\\n\\nPerhaps all these precautions are unnecessary, but White feels that he has\\nmore than enough time to prepare his attack, and wants to be secure in\\nevery way before he begins. {155}\\n\\n       21. ........               P - Kt 4\\n       22. P - K 4                P - B 5\\n       23. Q - B 2                Kt - K 6\\n\\nHe had better have played Kt - B 3; and tried later on to get rid of\\nWhite\\'s Knights by means of Kt - Q 2.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       24. R x Kt\\n\\nwith this sacrifice of the Rook for a Knight and Pawn White obtains an\\noverwhelming position.\\n\\n       24. ........               P x R\\n       25. Q x P                  Kt - B 1\\n\\nKt - Q 2 was better in order to get rid of one of the two White Knights.\\nThere were, however, any number of good replies to it, among them the\\nfollowing: Kt (B 5) x Kt, B x Kt; Q x P, Q x Q; Kt - B 7 ch, K - Kt 2;\\nKt x Q, and with two Pawns for the exchange, and the position so much in\\nhis favour, White should have no trouble in winning. {156}\\n\\n       26.

P - K 3                Kt - K 5\\n\\nI had played this defence twice before in the match with good results, and\\nalthough I lost this game I still played it until the very last game, when\\nI changed my tactics. The reason was my total lack of knowledge of the\\ndifferent variations in this opening, coupled with the fact that I knew\\nthat Dr. E. Lasker had been successful with it against Marshall himself in\\n1907. I thought that since Dr. Lasker had played it so often, it should be\\ngood. The object is to exchange a couple of pieces and at the same time to\\nbring about a position full of possibilities and with promising chances of\\nsuccess once the end-game stage is reached. On general principles it should\\nbe wrong, because the {160} same Knight is moved three times in the\\nopening, although it involves the exchange of two pieces. In reality the\\ndifficulty in this variation, as well as in nearly all the variations of\\nthe Queen\\'s gambit, lies in the slow development of Black\\'s Queen Bishop.\\nHowever, whether this variation can or cannot be safely played is a\\nquestion still to be decided, and it is outside the scope of this book. I\\nmay add that at present my preference is for a different system of\\ndevelopment, but it is not unlikely that I should some time come back to\\nthis variation.\\n\\n        6. B x B                  Q x B\\n        7. B - Q 3\\n\\nP x P is preferable for reasons that we shall soon see.\\n\\n        7. ........               Kt x Kt\\n        8. P x Kt                 Kt - Q 2\\n\\nNow P x P would be a better way to develop the game. The idea is that after\\n8...P x P; 9 B x B P, P - Q Kt 3, followed by B - Kt 2, would give Black\\'s\\nBishop a powerful range. For this variation see the eleventh game of the\\nmatch.\\n\\n        9. Kt - B 3               O - O\\n\\nNo longer would 9...P x P; 10 B x P, P - Q Kt 3 be good, because\\n11 B - Kt 5 would prevent B - Kt 2 on account of Kt - K 5. {161}\\n\\n       10.

P - Q R 4              P - B 4\\n\\nPlayed with the intention of obtaining the majority of Pawns on the Queen\\'s\\nside. Yet it is doubtful whether this move is good, since it leaves Black\\'s\\nQueen\\'s-side Pawns disrupted in a way. The safer course would have been to\\nplay P - B 3.\\n\\n       13. Q - R 3                P - Q Kt 3\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThis exposes Black to further attack by P - R 5 without any compensation\\nfor it. If I had to play this position nowadays I would simply play\\n13...R - K 1. Then after 14 Q x P, Q x Q would follow, and I believe that\\nBlack would regain the Pawn. If, instead, White played 14 P x P then\\nB - Kt 5 would give Black an excellent game.\\n\\n       14. P - R 5                B - Kt 2\\n       15. O - O                  Q - B 2\\n       16.

White\\'s development was\\nfirst introduced by Schlechter and elaborated later on by Rubinstein. It\\naims at the isolation of Black\\'s Q P, against which the White pieces are\\ngradually concentrated. In making the text move I was trying to avoid the\\nbeaten track. Being a developing move there should be no objection to it in\\nthe way of general principles, except that the Knights ought to come out\\nbefore the Bishops.\\n\\n        7.

The move in theory ought to be\\nunsound, since Black\\'s K Kt is yet undeveloped. I had not yet learned of\\nthe attack founded on Kt - Kt 5 and the exchange of the B at K 3. Either\\nKt - B 3 or P - K R 3; to prevent either B or Kt - K Kt 5, was right.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n        9. P X P                  B x P\\n       10.

Its good features are that it keeps the centre\\nintact without creating any particular weakness, and that it gives plenty\\nof opportunity for deep and concealed manoeuvring. The drawback is the long\\ntime it takes Black to develop his game. It is natural to suppose that\\nWhite will employ that time to prepare a well-conceived attack, or that he\\nwill use the advantage of his development actually to prevent Black\\'s\\ncomplete development, or failing that, to obtain some definite material\\nadvantage.\\n\\n       10.

It might be laid down as a principle of\\nthe opening that _the breaking up of the King\\'s side is of more importance\\nthan a similar occurrence on the Queen\\'s side_.\\n\\n        6.

It is, of course, expected that White will Castle on the King\\'s side\\nbecause of the broken-up condition of his Queen\\'s side Pawns. {176}\\n\\n        9.

O - O - O\\n\\nAn original idea, I believe, played for the first time in a similar\\nposition in a game against Mr. Walter Penn Shipley, of Philadelphia. My\\nidea is that as there is no Black Bishop and because Black\\'s pieces have\\nbeen developed with a view to an attack on the King\\'s side, it will be\\nimpossible for Black to take advantage of the apparently unprotected\\nposition of White\\'s King. Two possibilities must be considered. Firstly: If\\nBlack Castles on the Queen\\'s side, as in this game, it is evident that\\nthere is no danger of an attack. Secondly: If Black Castles on the King\\'s\\nside, White begins the attack first, taking advantage of the awkward\\nposition of Black\\'s Queen. In addition to the attacking probabilities of\\nthe text move, White in one move brings his King into safety and brings one\\nof his Rooks into play. Thus he gains several moves, \"tempi\" as they are\\ncalled, which will serve him to develop whatever plan he may wish to\\nevolve.\\n\\n       12. ........               O - O - O\\n       13.

Kt - Q B 3             Kt - K 2\\n\\nA perfectly sound form of development. In any other form adopted the Black\\nKt could not be developed either as quickly or as well. K 2 is the natural\\nposition for the Black Kt in this variation, in order not to obstruct\\nBlack\\'s Pawns, and also, in some eventualities, in order to go to K Kt 3.\\nThere is {183} also the possibility of its going to Q 5 via Q B 3 after\\nP - Q B 4.\\n\\n        9. O - O                  O - O\\n       10. P - B 4\\n\\nThis move I considered weak at the time, and I do still. It leaves the K P\\nweak, unless it advances to K 5, and it also makes it possible for Black to\\npin the Kt by B - Q B 4.\\n\\n       10. ........               R - K 1\\n\\nBest.

P - B 5\\n\\n[Illustration] {184}\\n\\nIt has been wrongly claimed that this wins the game, but I would like\\nnothing better than to have such a position again.

Dr.\\nLasker gives the following variation: 13...B x B; 14 R x B, P - B 4;\\n15 Q R - Q 1, B - Kt 2; 16 R - B 2, Q R - Q 1; 17 R x R, R x R; 18 R - Q 2,\\nR x R; 19 Kt x R, and he claims that White has the best of it. But, as\\nNiemzovitch pointed out immediately after the game, 16...Q R - Q 1 given in\\nDr. Lasker\\'s variation, is not the best. If 16...Q R - B 1 ! then White\\nwill have great difficulty in drawing the game, {185} since there is no\\ngood way to stop Black from playing Kt - B 3, followed by Kt - K 4,\\nthreatening Kt - B 5. And should White attempt to meet this manoeuvre by\\nwithdrawing the Kt at Kt 3; then the Black Knight can go to Q 5, and the\\nWhite Pawn at K 4 will be the object of the attack. Taking Dr. Lasker\\'s\\nvariation, however, whatever advantage there might be disappears at once if\\nBlack plays 19...Kt - B 3, threatening Kt - Kt 5 and also Kt - Q 5, neither\\nof which can be stopped. If White answers 20 Kt - Q 5, Kt - Q 5 for Black\\nwill at least draw. In fact, after 19...Kt - B 3 Black threatens so many\\nthings that it is difficult to see how White can prevent the loss of one or\\nmore Pawns.\\n\\n       14.

I intended to carry this plan either before or after\\nplaying P - K Kt 4 as the circumstances demanded. Now let us analyse:\\n17...P - B 4. If 18 Kt - Q 5, B x Kt; 19 P x B, P - Q Kt 4; and a careful\\nanalysis will show that Black has nothing to fear. Black\\'s plan in this\\ncase would be to work his Kt around to K 4, via Q B 1, Q Kt 3, and Q B 5 or\\nQ 2. Again, 17...P - B 4; 18 R - B 2, P - Q 4; 19 P x P, B x P; 20 Kt x B\\n(best, since if R (B 2) - Q 2, B x Kt give Black the advantage), R x Kt;\\n21 R x R, Kt x R; and there is no good reason why Black should lose.\\n\\n       17. ........

Had I now\\nplayed R x Kt; P x R ch, R x P; as I intended to do when I went back with\\nthe Knight to B 1, I doubt very much if White would have been able to win\\nthe game. At least it would have been extremely difficult.\\n\\n       22. K - B 2                R - R 2\\n       23. P - Kt 4               P - R 3\\n       24. R - Q 3                P - Q R 4\\n       25.

He should have played his Rook to Kt 3 on the 27th move.\\nBlack now should have played P - Kt 4 ch. After missing this chance White\\nhas it all his own way, and finishes the game most accurately, and Black\\nbecomes more {188} helpless with each move. The game needs no further\\ncomment, excepting that my play throughout was of an altogether irresolute\\ncharacter. When a plan is made, it must be carried out if at all possible.\\nRegarding the play of White, I consider his 10th and 12th moves were very\\nweak; he played well after that up to the 27th move, which was bad, as well\\nas his 28th move.

White\\'s position is evidently free\\nfrom danger and his pieces can easily manoeuvre.\\n\\nOn Black\\'s side the first thing we notice is that he has retained both his\\nBishops, unquestionably an advantage; but on the other hand we find his\\npieces bunched together too much, and the Queen in danger of being attacked\\nwithout having any good square to go to. The Bishop at K 2 has no freedom\\nand it blocks the Queen, which, in its turn, blocks the Bishop. Besides,\\nBlack cannot Castle on the King\\'s side because Q x P, R - Kt 1; Q - K 4\\nthreatening mate, wins a Pawn. Nor can he Castle on the Queen\\'s side\\nbecause Q - R 5 would put Black\\'s game in imminent danger, since he cannot\\nplay P - R 3 because of B x P; nor can he play K - Kt 1 because of\\nKt - Kt 5.

Therefore, in this form of development, the Bishop,\\n{232} we might say, exerts its maximum strength (Compare this note with the\\none in the Capablanca-Burn game at San Sebastian, page 197.)\\n\\n        7. Kt - B 3               B - Kt 2\\n        8. B - Kt 5               Kt - B 3\\n\\nOf course not K Kt - K 2; because of Kt - Q 5. The alternative would have\\nbeen P - B 3; to be followed by K Kt - K 2; but in this position it is\\npreferable to have the Kt at K B 3.\\n\\n        9. Q - Q 2                P - K R 3\\n       10. B - K R 4\\n\\nAn error of judgment. White wants to keep the Knight pinned, but it was\\nmore important to prevent Black from Castling immediately. B - K B 4 would\\nhave done this.\\n\\n       10. ........               O - O\\n       11. O - O - O\\n\\nBold play, but again faulty judgment, unless he intended to play to win or\\nlose, throwing safety to the winds. The Black Bishop at Kt 2 becomes a very\\npowerful attacking piece. The strategical disposition of the Black pieces\\nis now far superior to White\\'s, therefore it will be Black who will take\\nthe offensive.\\n\\n       11. ........

P - Kt 4 !\\n\\nNow that the K R is in the centre, Black can safely advance, since, in\\norder to attack on the King\\'s side, White would have to shift his Rooks,\\nwhich he cannot do so long as Black keeps up the pressure in the centre.\\n\\n       13. B - Kt 3               Kt - K R 4\\n\\nUncovering the Bishop, which now acts along the long diagonal, and at the\\nsame time preventing P - K 5, which would be answered by Kt x B; P x Kt,\\nKt x P; etc., winning a Pawn.\\n\\n       14. Kt - Q 5               P - R 3\\n\\nBlack drives the Bishop away so as to _unpin_ his pieces and be able to\\nmanoeuvre freely. {234}\\n\\n       15. B - Q 3                B - K 3\\n\\nPreparing the onslaught. Black\\'s pieces begin to bear against the King\\'s\\nposition.\\n\\n       16. P - B 3\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWith the last move White not only blocks the action of Black\\'s K B, but he\\nalso aims at placing his Bishop at Q Kt 1 and his Queen at Q B 2, and then\\nadvancing his K P, to check at K R 7.\\n\\n       16. ........               P - B 4 !\\n\\nInitiating an attack to which there is no reply, and which has for its\\nultimate object either the winning of the White Q B or cutting it off from\\nthe game. (Compare this game with the Winter-Capablanca game at Hastings.)\\n\\n       17. P - K R 4              P - B 5\\n\\nThe Bishop is now out of action. White naturally counter attacks violently\\nagainst the seemingly {235} exposed position of the Black King, and, with\\nvery good judgment, even offers the Bishop.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       18. P x P !                P x P !\\n\\nTaking the Bishop would be dangerous, if not actually bad, while the text\\nmove accomplishes Black\\'s object, which is to put the Bishop out of action.\\n\\n       19. R - R 1                B - B 2\\n       20. K - Kt 1\\n\\nThis move unquestionably loses time. Since he would have to retire his\\nBishop to R 2 sooner or later, he might have done it immediately. It is\\ndoubtful, however, if at this stage of the game it would be possible for\\nWhite to save the game.\\n\\n       20. ........               Kt - K 4\\n       21. Kt x Kt                R x Kt\\n\\nIt was difficult to decide which way to retake. I {236} took with the Rook\\nin order to have it prepared for a possible attack against the King.\\n\\n       22. B - R 2                Kt - B 3\\n\\nNow that the White Bishop has been driven back, Black wants to get rid of\\nWhite\\'s strongly posted Knight at Q 5, which blocks the attack of the\\nBishop at B 2. It may be said that the Knight at Q 5 is the key to White\\'s\\ndefence.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       23. P - Kt 3\\n\\nWhite strives not only to have play for his Bishop, but also he wants to\\nbreak up Black\\'s Pawns in order to counter-attack. The alternative would\\nhave been 23 Kt x Kt ch, Q x Kt; and Black would be threatening R - R 4,\\nand also Q - K 3. The student should notice that Black\\'s drawback in all\\nthis is the fact that he is playing minus the services of his Q R. It is\\nthis fact that makes it possible for White to hold out longer. {237}\\n\\n       23. ........               Kt x P\\n       24. B x Kt                 R x B\\n       25.

I\\nhad played it before in this Tournament against Kostic, and no doubt\\nMarshall expected it. At times I change my defences, {239} or rather\\nsystems of defence; on the other hand, during a Tournament, if one of them\\nhas given me good results, I generally play it all the time.\\n\\n        8.

Q x Kt                 P - Q Kt 3\\n\\nThis is the key to this system of defence. Having simplified the game\\nconsiderably by a series of exchanges, Black will now develop his Q B along\\nthe long diagonal without having created any apparent weakness. The proper\\ndevelopment of the Q B is Black\\'s greatest problem in the Queen\\'s Gambit.\\n\\n       13. P - K 4                B - Kt 2\\n       14. K R - K 1              K R - Q 1\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe developing stage can now be said to be complete on both sides. The\\nopening is over and the middle-game begins. White, as is generally the\\ncase, has {240} obtained the centre. Black, on the other hand, is\\nentrenched in his first three ranks, and if given time will post his Q R at\\nQ B 1 and his Knight at K B 3, and finally play P - Q B 4, in order to\\nbreak up White\\'s centre and give full action to the Black Bishop posted at\\nQ Kt 2. In this game White attempts to anticipate that plan by initiating\\nan advance on the centre, which, when carefully analysed, is truly an\\nattack against Black\\'s K P.\\n\\n       15. P - Q 5                Kt - B 4 !\\n\\nAgainst Kostic in a previous game I had played Kt - B 1. It was\\ncarelessness on my part, but Marshall believed differently, otherwise he\\nwould not have played this variation, since, had he analysed this move, he\\nwould, I think, have realised that Black would obtain an excellent game.\\nBlack now threatens not only B P x P; but also Kt x P; followed by B P x P.\\nThe position is very interesting and full of possibilities.\\n\\n[Illustration] {241}\\n\\n       16. P x K P                Kt x P (K 3)\\n       17. B x Kt                 Q x B\\n\\nplayed under the impression that White had to lose time in defending his\\nQ R P, when I could play P - Q B 4, obtaining a very superior game. But, as\\nwill be seen, my opponent had quite a little surprise for me.\\n\\n       18. Kt - Q 4 !\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       18. ........               Q - K 4 !\\n\\nOf course, if 18...Q x R P; 19 R - R 1 would win the Queen. The text move\\nis probably the only satisfactory move in the position. The obvious move\\nwould have been Q - Q 2 to defend the Q B P, and then would have come\\n19 Kt - B 5, P - B 3; 20 Q - K Kt 3 (threatening Q R - Q 1), K - R 1;\\n21 Q R - Q 1, Q - K B 2; 22 P - K R 4, with a tremendous advantage in\\nposition. The text move, on the other hand, assures Black an even game at\\nthe very least, as will soon be seen. {242}\\n\\n       19. Kt x P                 Q x Q\\n       20. R x Q                  R - Q 7\\n       21. R - Kt 1\\n\\nA very serious error of judgment. White is under the impression that he has\\nthe better game, because he is a Pawn ahead, but that is not so. The\\npowerful position of the Black Rook at Q 7 fully compensates Black for the\\nPawn minus. Besides, the Bishop is better with Rooks than the Knight (see\\npages 48-56, where the relative values of the Knight and Bishop are\\ncompared), and, as already stated, with Pawns on both sides of the board\\nthe Bishop is superior because of its long range. Incidentally, this ending\\nwill demonstrate the great power of the Bishop. White\\'s best chance was to\\ntake a draw at once, thus. 21 Kt - K 7 ch K - B 1; 22 R - B 7 R - K 1 (not\\nB x P; because P - B 3 would give White the best of it); 23 R x B (best;\\nnot Kt - Kt 6 ch, because of B P x Kt; followed by R x K P), R x Kt;\\n24 R - Kt 8 ch, R - K 1; 25 R x R ch, K x R, and with proper play White\\nwill draw.\\n\\nIt is curious that, although a Pawn ahead, White is the one who is always\\nin danger. It is only now, after seeing this analysis, that the value of\\nBlack\\'s 18th move Q - K 4 can be fully appreciated.\\n\\n       21. ........               R - K 1\\n\\nWith this powerful move Black begins, against White\\'s centre, an assault\\nwhich will soon be shifted against {243} the King itself. White is afraid\\nto play 22 P - B 3 because of P - B 4.\\n\\n       22. P - K 5                P - K Kt 4\\n\\nTo prevent P - B 4. The White Knight is practically pinned, because he does\\nnot dare move on account of R x K P.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n       23. P - K R 4\\n\\nThis is a sequel to the previous move. White expects to disrupt Black\\'s\\nPawns, and thus make them weak.\\n\\n       23. ........               P x P\\n\\nThough doubled and isolated this Pawn exercises enormous pressure. Black\\nnow threatens R - K 3; to be followed by R - Kt 3 and P - R 6 and R 7 at\\nthe proper time.\\n\\n       24. R - K 1\\n\\nWhite cannot stand the slow death any longer. {244} He sees danger\\neverywhere, and wants to avert it by giving up his Queen\\'s side Pawns,\\nexpecting to regain his fortunes later on by taking the initiative on the\\nKing\\'s side.\\n\\n       24. ........               R - K 3 !\\n\\nMuch better than taking Pawns. This forces White to defend the Knight with\\nthe Rook at K 1, because of the threat R - Kt 3.\\n\\n       25. R (K1) - Q B 1         K - Kt 2\\n\\nPreparatory to R - Kt 3. The game is going to be decided on the King\\'s\\nside, and it is the isolated double Pawn that will supply the finishing\\ntouch.\\n\\n       26. P - Q Kt 4             P - Kt 4\\n\\nTo prevent P - Kt 5, defending the Knight and liberating the Rooks.\\n\\n       27. P - R 3                R - Kt 3\\n       28. K - B 1                R - R 7\\n\\n[Illustration] {245}\\n\\nNotice the remarkable position of the pieces. White cannot move anything\\nwithout incurring some loss. His best chance would have been to play\\n29 P - K 6, but that would only have prolonged the game, which is lost in\\nany case.\\n\\n       29. K - Kt 1               P - R 6\\n       30.
